        "abstract": "For the 2016 Senior Design project, our team elected to design and construct a short-span pedestrian bridge for the 24th National Timber Bridge Design Competition. The competition was sponsored by the Southwest Mississippi RC&D council (SMRCD) of the Forest Products Society in association with the American Society of Civil Engineers. There were a number of different design and testing requirements to abide by, including both competition regulations as well as AASHTO guidelines pertaining to the construction of pedestrian bridges. [1] A great deal of diligence was taken to assure that our team performed well in the competition; every rule and regulation was carefully considered and designed to. [5] Throughout the course of this project our team was exposed to many aspects of a structural engineering project: an iterative design process, procurement coordination, and construction.\n The bridge performed really well during testing, deflecting a mere 7.58m, which was only about 73% of the allowed deflection of 0.42”. This performance, along with other bridge characteristics, lead to the team placing 1st nationally in the competition. Furthermore, in order to contribute to the development of our surrounding community, we worked extensively with the Santa Clara County Parks to arrange a donation. Our hopes are to one-day encounter our finished product in a local park.",

        "abstract": "3D printing of carbon fiber composites has been a developing technology for about 5 years, and in this time, Arevo Labs has established itself as a leader in the field. Our team joined forces with Arevo, who sponsored our project as we showcased their new, innovative carbon fiber manufacturing process. To do so, we focused on the conceptual design, analysis, assembly, and material testing of an electric mountain-bike frame printed with Arevo’s continuous carbon fiber printing technology. Our bike consists of the main frame and a chain stay subsystem, which connects the rear wheel to the rest of the frame and interfaces with a suspension system. Understanding how the capabilities of the printer, the properties of the materials, and the typical loading scenarios experienced by mountain bikes all worked together was paramount in analysis, simulation, and design optimization and iteration. Thus, the focus of this project is to design a mountain bike capable of withstanding typical loading patterns with a high level of safety. Further, the team aimed to optimize a bike frame which used the minimal amount of material necessary to reduce weight and cost for the user.",

        "abstract": "Glaucoma is one of the leading cause of blindness in the modern age, with more than 65,000,000 afflicted individuals world-wide. High intraocular pressure (IOP) is the main risk factor of the disease. Current methods of monitoring IOP require a visit to an opthamologist and expensive medical equipment which greatly reduces the frequency of measurement. We utilize 3D printing to develop an apparatus that will allow us to take accurate pictures of an implantable IOP sensor with a smartphone camera. This apparatus has a lens to magnify the image and an illumination system to provide appropriate lighting. Our results show that viable images can be taken of the sensor using the final design of the apparatus. We discovered that lighting of the eye could be achieved through the smartphone’s built-in flash directed through a fiber optics cable. However, the small window of focus on the sensor created inconsistencies in our images. Consequently, future developments of our apparatus should integrate with a proprietary app that will manage image focus and processing, and submit data directly to the patient’s doctor. Improved lighting can increase image quality by improving the seals between the phone, apparatus, and eye and reducing hotspots on the sensor.",

        "abstract": "This project entails designing, prototyping, and testing a 3D scanner. The device that we are building uses LIDAR to take position data of a 3D object, then analyze and encode the sensor data as an STL file that can later be 3D printed out at the same resolution. We aim to build an affordable, high-performance 3D scanner that takes advantage of the falling cost of LIDAR in order to bring 3D scanning capabilities to individuals, the maker community, and even small businesses.\n We begin this process by choosing a sensor, the YDLIDAR X4, as our primary method of taking position data of the object. We take calibration data with this sensor to ensure that it is suitable to our needs. In doing so, we find that we may need to incorporate certain statistical methods, like dithering, in order to increase the accuracy of the system. We determine an effective layout for scanning all sides of an object, overcoming obstacles like scanning objects with concave surfaces. The physical system is mocked up in Solidworks, enabling us to 3D print, laser cut, and buy all the necessary components of the system. The system is constructed while an interactive user interface is created. We develop an algorithm for turning individual data points from the raw data of the X4 sensor into 3D printable STL files, and interface it with a program that controls the motors to take consistent, comprehensive scans of any object on the platform.\n In the end, we find two limitations of LIDAR in 3D scanning systems - high-gloss black surfaces and certain steep angles cannot be scanned adequately by LIDAR. However, once our system is constructed, we are able to take 3D scans of common objects, and even 3D print one of our scanned objects. The scan is compared to the original object, and the dimensional accuracy of our scanner is verified.",

If data is corrupted on any single storage device, the data may be restored from a set of other storage devices. Furthermore, the architecture of this sytem enhances security and privacy. This is because in our Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network there is no single organizing entity or corporation that controls all the data. Therefore, there is no single target that hackers or governments can attack to steal data.

The technology can permanently alter the genome, providing an alternative therapy to drugs and surgery. Specifically, gene therapy is a promising treatment option for many incurable genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and muscular cell dystrophy. Our project gives rise to a better understanding of TALENs and its uses in the genetic engineering field. TALENs, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, are a genetic engineering technology that can be used for targeted gene modification. They are engineered proteins that can bind to specific sequences of DNA and induce a double-stranded break. The DNA sequence that the TALENs bind to is determined by the user; therefore the TALENs can be engineered to target specific DNA sequences that cause genetic diseases. We used TALENs within the model organism, nematode C. elegans, to explore their potential for use in gene therapy. By utilizing TALENs to introduce a lin-31 mutant into the genome of C. elegans we aim to advance the understanding of TALENs as a genetic engineering tool and contribute to the research on the docking site of LIN-31 in the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway.

        "abstract": "The Achilles tendon, which stretches from the calf to the ankle, can be injured due to repeated daily activities or overstretching. In severe cases a tear in the tendon can prevent athletes from performing in games as well as individuals from completing their daily tasks. Achilles tendon injuries affect millions of people. The severe pain that occurs upon injury can take months to improve and for the Achilles tendon to heal. Our goal is to design an auxetic support to provide comfort, help heal the tendon, and allow the individual to continue to be active through the natural healing process. The auxetic will help protect from further injury when the individual is active because when force is applied longitudinally it results in expansion laterally leading to a shortening of the tendon, which promotes healing. This support is fabricated using elastomer molds that incorporate auxetic patterning, which was determined through testing, to make the device active while the individual is moving while wearing the support. The pieces are individually made, then pieced together to form the heel portion of the support, which is the crucial component for Achilles tendon healing. With compression testing we discovered that the Young’s modulus of our auxetic structure is similar to that of the calcaneus tissue so it will be comfortable for the user. With shock absorption testing we were able to compare the energy absorption off our auxetic structure compared to bulk elastomers and foams. Overall, we believe the optimal auxetic heel support is comfortable and shock absorptive and heel supports should be made so they are capable of facilitating healing and protect from further injury of the Achilles tendon when an individual is active.",

        "abstract": "The California water crisis has left over one-million residents without potable water. This crisis is due to a multitude of issues: climate change, drought, groundwater overdraft and groundwater contamination. This technical report reviews solutions to the implications of groundwater well contamination. Pollutants contaminate aquifers, affecting small rural communities; one such location is East Orosi, Tulare County, California, a community of 700 people. The community’s only water source is a nitrate-contaminated well. Contamination can be lethal, and a solution to provide the region with potable water is necessary. This technical report summarizes a broad scope of solutions that East Orosi can choose from to address their water crisis: an immediate water relief plan, a new groundwater well, a pipeline diverting clean water into the existing East Orosi water distribution system, and a water treatment plant. A preliminary cost analysis and general scope for each solution has been detailed. A comparison of each proposed solution has found that the most suitable design is the construction of a new groundwater well to reach a lower, uncontaminated aquifer. The team recommends East Orosi’s community conduct a hydrogeologic analysis of the local aquifers to determine if there is sufficient potable water before pursuing the construction of a new well.",

The design process for this product was organized in three subsystems: lifting mechanism, escape prevention, and frame. The lifting mechanism is designed to accommodate the bed’s variable height, as well as support the weight of the mattress and patient up to 800 lb. The escape prevention system prevents the patient from escaping or accidentally falling out of bed. Finally, the frame provides structural support for the entire system, and is the framework for the other subsystems.

Finally, a traffic study for the Stevens Creek at Agilent intersection was conducted and with the data an optimized signal timing plan for the morning conditions was created. In essence, this project seeks to promote the use of alternative modes of transportation for Agilent employees and other users passing through this area by changing and proposing new facilities pertaining to pedestrian and cyclist usage. In addition, the signal timing for the intersection will mitigate the current vehicular flow conditions to provide for a more efficient movement.

The goal of the app if it were to be implemented outside of the senior design project would be to let anyone with access to a phone use the app wherever they are by taking a picture of a potentially cancerous mole and receive a classification on the spot based on machine learning analysis clearly stating if the mole is cancerous or not. If the app diagnoses an image as malignant the patient then knows they should invest the time and money to get to the nearest doctor to have the mole checked and get the appropriate treatment. The final product we developed for our senior design project is only a prototype and proof-of-concept though as a health app would need to receive FDA approval before being okayed to be used by the general public. We would need to devote more attention to exploring machine learning models to increase the accuracy of the classification and run thorough tests as a part of the process to achieve FDA approval for an app like this. The product we developed is an app that users can take a picture of their mole with and then see the classification of the image they took, whether the mole is cancerous or not, on the app. We only classified Skin Cancer Images as cancerous or not, we did not classify if they were Melanoma or not. That required an extra layer of classification that we were not able to do within the time of our project because we wanted to complete all of our critical requirements. The classification accuracy we achieved was only about 82 percent so we recommend that the machine learning aspect of the project be further explored to find a model that achieves a higher accuracy. We used Flutter to develop our app and the random forest classifier for our machine learning model. We discuss the other technologies we used for our project in the following report, as well as our design plan going into the project, how we implemented the project, societal connections from the project, lessons learned, and future work for the project. IMPORTANT: PLEASE NOTE anywhere the word diagnose, diagnosis, diagnosed, or diagnoser is used in the paper and on the app which you’ll see screenshots of below for the sake of our senior design project only means a classification of an image as cancerous (Malignant) or non-cancerous (Benign), it does not imply an official diagnosis.

AkaBot was designed to allow end users to produce their own filament from a PET plastic input. AkaBot was designed and manufactured to created filament that has the required ductility for spooling and use in a 3D printer. It functioned well with PET pellets as the plastic input, but it was not as successful when trying to use recycled water bottles. The final filament product is dependent on the tension put on the filament as it exits the machine. At present, a skilled human operator is required to consistently produce acceptable filament. An automated spooling system for the filament would greatly improve the consistency of the output and decrease the cost of using AkaBot.",

The analysis will be used to characterize the bioamines: dopamine, octopamine, tyramine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA). The device measures the concentration of bioamines in microdialysate samples taken directly from the pericardial cavity of the crab. The research on Jonah crabs will be applied to enhance our understanding of the crab neurology. Since the structure and in some instances, the function of the neuromodulators are conserved, this research may be applicable to human studies. Researchers who use our device will be able to detect nanomolar concentrations of bioamines. This will help them to better understand the nervous system of crabs. This could also lead to a better understanding of the human nervous system and how to treat and manage neurodegenerative diseases. In order to obtain data, the device incorporates carbon paste electrodes modiﬁed with carbon nanotubes, which literature suggests should be able to detect 50 nanomolar concentrations using amperometry. Moreover, the buffer solution includes sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles to separate two structural isomers of interest - octopamine and dopamine - by their difference in afﬁnity. Combining these methods and applying voltage across the long channel separates bioamines via electroosmotic ﬂow (EOF) based on their electrophoretic mobility. At the end of the CE channel there are electrodes to measure bioamine concentration via AD. An SU-8 mold was prepared by standard lithography techniques. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channels were formed from an SU-8 mold through replica molding. Carbon paste electrodes were screen printed into the PDMS electrode channel. We observed electroosmotic ﬂow in CE by inserting ﬂuoroisothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran dye and applying high voltage. Electrodes were placed in channel near the outlet to electrochemically detect the concentration of each bioamine. The limit of detection (LOD) for carbon paste electrodes was observed to be 10 mM using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). Our device provides low cost fabrication, high time resolution, high sensitivity, and multi-analyte detection of bioamines in Cancer borealis.",

As a result, there is an immense interest in studying GPCRs as this area provides further knowledge into the specific disease pathways and allows the discovery of novel therapeutics. In order to have a better understanding of pathways, scientists have studied GPCR activation. The prostanoid receptors are of great interest because they coordinate a vast range of physiological processes such as regulating cardiovascular pathways, modulating neuronal activity and controlling immune responses. We collaborated with Multispan Inc., a biotech company focusing exclusively on drug discovery research targeting GPCRs, to monitor the agonist-induced internalization of GPCRs from the prostanoid family through live cell flow cytometry. From our experimental results, we have observed over 50 percent internalization for the EP1 and EP4 receptors within 60 minutes after being activated by iloprost and PGE2 respectively. Our initial experimental results have also shown over 40 percent internalization for the TP receptor within 120 minutes after exposure to PGD2. Overall, we have been able to utilize Multispan’s proprietary cell lines to overexpress a few of the prostanoid receptors. These assays are powerful tools for the discovery of novel therapeutics, as they enable the testing against libraries and screening from a few thousand to a few million compounds.",

This novel technology will improve the field-of-view (FoV) in current forward-facing optical probes. We focused on developing an optical probe that could scan 30° field-of-view, which could potentially increase the viewing area almost an order of magnitude. As steps towards developing a clinically useful probe, we have characterized i) durability ii) control accuracy iii) and optical clarity of the device. We have utilized two different commercially available silicone materials: Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS - RTV615) from Momentive Inc. and Ecoflex from Smooth-On Inc (Ecoflex 00-10). In our tests, we have varied the physical parameters such as Young’s modulus and device architecture. We found that using a lower Young’s modulus material (Ecoflex) significantly reduced the actuation pressure, therefore it is preferable to more rigid materials. We also found that as the device aspect ratio (wall height: wall width) increases, the actuation pressure has increased. By using 3D printed molds we were able to achieve an aspect ratio of four. To achieve optical clarity we have carefully filled the chambers of ASOC, made of PDMS, with its liquid pre-polymer to match the refractive index of chambers with the walls. We have developed a protocol to fill the small chambers with the highly viscous pre-polymer in a bubble free manner to eliminate the optical scattering sites. For most optical applications where lenses have to be used, the PDMS device is more viable than the Ecoflex device due to the optical clarity advantage. For future purposes, a material that had combined benefits of the Ecoflex and PDMS materials would be ideal in completing all goals with a single device.",

Aptamers offer inherent benefits over antibodies, which are the primary agents used in traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), while demonstrating comparable sensitivity.

Ultimately this project furthers the needs and goals of power, food, and water security in the developing world, while protecting and advancing global environmental interests through quantifiable system milestones that breakdown into system integration proposals utilizing novel mixotrophic mechanisms, experimental design, and associated control system synthesis. We will also include optimization procedures, automating system maintenance, decoupling supplemental CO2 injections and mixotrophic CO2 inputs, and power balance extrapolations. The quantifier of success of these metrics is their facilitation towards net-power positive and net-zero carbon emission systems, apropos viable sustainable smallholder aquaponics. The systems that will need to be implemented include algae monitoring and eventually direct extrapolations from this parameter to mass, via image analysis and select dataset correlations, as well as modeling CO2 control via pH control, as well as potential temperature, humidity, and light regulation. We would use these in conjunction with an Arduino. We will design a proportional integral controller to control CO2.

The design process included meeting the competition loading of 4500 pounds as well as the 150 psf requirement outlined in the American Association State Highway Transportation Officials Guide to Pedestrian Bridge Design. The deflection limits for the competition were L/100 for the deck span (0.105”) and L/400 for the bridge span (0.420”). In addition, all dimension restrictions for the competition were considered for all alternatives considered. A detailed evaluation of three alternatives was conducted to choose the best alternative: simple beam bridge, Gambrel truss bridge, and a Pratt truss bridge. The final design selected for construction was the Pratt truss bridge that used redwood and Douglas Fir Larch for all members. The bridge performed slightly different than expected when loaded with 4500lbs; a deflection of 0.45” versus the 0.42” allowable was observed. Despite exceeding the allowable deflection by 0.03” the team was able to place in two of the six categories, second place in best deck design and most practical design. The bridge is being transported to a local farm in Watsonville, California where it will be used by a farmer to cross a ravine.",

Therefore, development of technologies for hand and extremity rehabilitation is a significant area of research that will directly help patients recovering from hand debilities sustained from causes ranging from stroke and Parkinson’s disease to trauma and common injuries. Cyclic activity recognition and assessment is appropriate for hand and extremity rehabilitation because a majority of our essential motions are cyclic in their nature. For a patient on the road to regaining functional independence with daily skills, the improvement in cyclic motions constitutes an important and quantifiable rehabilitation goal. However, challenges exist with hand rehabilitation sensor technologies preventing acquisition of long-term, continuous, accurate and actionable motion data. These challenges include complicated and uncomfortable system assemblies, and a lack of integration with consumer electronics for easy readout. In our research, we have developed a glove based system where the inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors are used synergistically with the flexible sensors to minimize the number of IMU sensors. The classification capability of our system is improved by utilizing a fuzzy logic data analysis algorithm. We tested a total of 25 different subjects using a glove-based apparatus to gather data on two-dimensional motions with one accelerometer and three-dimensional motions with one accelerometer and two flexible sensors. Our research provides an approach that has the potential to utilize both activity recognition and activity assessment using simple sensor systems to help patients recover and improve their overall quality of life.",

        "abstract": "Logic Locking is an emerging form of hardware obfuscation that is intended to be a solution to many of the trust issues associated with the modern globalized IC supply chain. By inserting extra key-gates into a circuit, the functionality of the circuit can be locked until the correct order of bits or “key” is applied to the key gates. To assess the strength of new logic locking techniques, we propose a new attack that uses deep reinforcement learning. This attack aims to test logic locking as well as evaluate reinforcement learning as a possible attack against logic locking. By using a deep Q-learning neural network, Q-values can be approximated and the model can be trained much faster than using traditional Q-learning. By allowing the model to change a single bit in the key each timestep, simulations of the circuit with the key produced can be run and the outputs can be compared to that of the unlocked version of the circuit, called an oracle. A reward is calculated based on how many bits of the locked circuit are correct and is used to reinforce the learning of the model. During the training phases of the model, the relationship between a highly correct key and how correct the outputs are for some random inputs is not strong, causing the model to struggle to learn quickly.",

In many places, this can lead to problems with alcohol management policy enforcement, venue security, and ultimately a significant loss of potential sales. Though the market for automated sale and serving of food and beverage is rapidly growing, there are many complications that arise from selling age-controlled beverages. Reliable and secure ID verification, quick payment, and quality control are all must-haves for integration into any major venue.\n This paper details the conceptualization, design, fabrication, and testing of AutoDraft, a new product designed specifically to alleviate the issues of pouring beer at large venues with the goal of increasing sales, enhancing safety, and improving the customer experience. The final prototype accomplishes this with a 3-step ‘tap-place-pour’ process that quickly moves the customer through age verification, selection, and pouring. Age verification and payment is handled with non-transferrable NFC-enabled wristbands, while an automatic system reliably controls the tilting and pouring of beer. These systems are all controlled by a central Arduino, which communicates over Bluetooth with an Android tablet that supports the custom-built user interface.\n By streamlining the age validation, payment, and pouring process, AutoDraft decreases the average time-to-serve for repeat customers from 60s on average down to just 20s, as shown in our validation [1]. Our product also functionally eliminates the ability for users to illegally acquire beverages and provides per-user and aggregate data for venues to make use of. Our final prototype was very well received by end-users, 95% of whom rated the product a 4 or 5 out of 5 for its overall intuitiveness.",

This is to be executed first using a robotic arm, to automate and create mobility, and second, including image verification, to classify and select pills based on certain characteristics. Through the incorporation of mixed-dose packaging, this product will generalize this service to larger markets such as hospitals and pharmacies that are otherwise only provided to individuals by third parties at an extra cost. Within our time frame, we have obtained successful dispensing for a preliminary set of pills based on color, size, and shape.",

        "abstract": "Athletes are always seeking ways to improve their performance. Down time and a lack of capable throwers prevent athletic receivers from practicing their skills. We hope to aid athletes in receiving drills within their respective sports and increase practice efficiency. In order to achieve this, the machine has one major axis of rotation driven by a motor. This enables it to adjust where the ball is being thrown. Using an Arduino Uno coupled with a Roboteq AX1500 motor driver, the Automated Precision Passing System is able to throw a ball to a specified point in space by adjusting both the azimuth and ball-throwing motor speed. Our testing shows that our prototype has the ability to position itself in three different orientations as well as adjust the launch motor speed, but we were unable to launch the ball the original distance that we desired. From this project, we gained valuable knowledge in the areas of machine design, control systems, and project management. In order to continue the project and create a functional consumer product there are several improvements that need to be made to the system. The Automated Precision Passing System needs to be more rigid, have more power, and include more throwing positions.",

An automated trimmer can alleviate the most time consuming step in the cut-trim-bag harvesting process, increasing the yields of robotic cutters or the speed of existing laborer teams. Leveraging the Partner Farm’s existing trimmer architecture, which consists of a laborer loading lettuce into sprungloaded grippers that are rotated through vision and cutting systems by an indexer, the team redesigned geometry to improve the loading, gripping, and ejection stages of the system. Physical testing, hand calculations, and FEA were performed to understand acceptable grip strengths and cup design, and several wooden mockups were built to explore a new actuating linkage design for the indexer. The team manufactured, assembled, and performed verification testing on a full-size metal motorized prototype that can be incorporated with the Partner Farm’s existing cutting and vision systems. The prototype met all of the established requirements, and the farm has implemented the redesign onto their trimmer. Future work would include designing and implementing vision and cutting systems for the team’s metal prototype.",

This benefits their future endeavors of having helpful cobots navigate and assist entities in their respective environments. This paper documents the development of software for a cobot that satisfies the basic requirements for easy and safe control of an autonomous robot within a dynamic environment. The completed software includes the ability for the cobot to track a person and then autonomously follow that person around at a safe following distance and a safe speed. If the cobot collides with an object while navigating, it stops almost instantaneously. Furthermore, the software enables the cobot to be told to go to a straight-ahead destination within a room and then navigate to that destination using a positioning system. Another function provided with the cobot is for the user to take over control of the cobot with a touch joystick on a tablet. Lastly, all of these different functions can be selected or switched between using a tablet interface for control. Overall, the software developed for the cobot satisfies basic requirements provided by the RSL and L2F to have safe and straightforward control of the cobot. The software provides the foundation for future research and academics and professional efforts in developing a complete system for all desired functionalities desired by SCU and L2F.",

This is problematic in modern building floor plans with glass walls. A solution is to build a ROS system that fuses ultrasonic sensors with LiDAR sensors in order for a robot to navigate in a building that has glass walls. Using both sensors, the final product is a robot that creates a 2D map using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) as well as other pertinent Robotics Operating Systems (ROS) packages. This map enables any mobile robot to pathplan from point A to B on the now created 2D floor plan that incorporates glass and non-glass obstacles.

The goal is to demonstrate the novel applications of the Vertisense™ thermal atomic force microscope probe, developed by AppNano with regards to biological materials. Gold and Silver nanoand microparticles were imaged, as well as spider silk and carbon nanotube/epoxy test samples. We demonstrated that the Vertisense™ probe is capable of imaging unique thermal characteristics regardless of topography by means of captured spider silk, and developed a process to immobilize and scan other kinds of substances with greater ease in the future. We believe that the results of our project can lead to improved methods of imaging in medicine and cell biology.",

        "abstract": "For this project, we have implemented an integrated interactive platform tailored for students and professors. Classes at Santa Clara University come in a variety of sizes and styles, with multiple professors teaching multiple students. These professors have different teaching methods that have to cater to students' different learning styles. One of the main features of our platform is a chat room where professors can collect information from their students. Students are able to ask questions about said topic or answer the professor's posted questions about the topic as well as other students' questions. With our platform, we hope to increase the interactivity between student and professor, making keeping up in class a smoother and more active experience. The main technologies implemented in this project are basic web languages: HTML, Javascript, and CSS. One of the main goals of the project was to be as simple as possible to minimize distractions, so we used the Bootstrap framework to keep our site organized and consistent. The backbone of our project is an online database driven by Parse that stores all of our chat log data, our user data, and the Power Point slides required to run our project. We tested this project in multiple classrooms with various class demographics. Results are generally positive, with most student users recommending this system to their other professors. The students enjoyed the comfort of being able to ask questions without anxiety or fear of embarrassment due to our anonymity feature we implemented. The professors greatly appreciated the increased amount of participation that Boip provided as well as their ability to answer questions on the fly without having to interrupt the lecture with students raising their hands. Overall, the tempo of the lectures were greatly increased and the general flow was improved.\n Some key features that would be helpful if implemented would include a more integrated method to insert Power Point slides and a filtration system for the chatroom. Currently, chatting can get a little out of hand with spam and inappropriate messages. So far we have countered this by having the professor emphasize professionalism before his or her lecture, but a more blunt idea would be to implemented a chat filter that would block inappropriate key words. The second thing that would be helpful is a more integrated method of uploading slides. The method of uploading slides can be tedious as one has to constantly switch tabs to Google Drive to enable permissions and grab the URL of a slideshow, so hopefully in the future adding a friendlier method of adding slides would greatly increase the platform's usability and make it easier on professors.",

        "abstract": "With the need for alternatives to fossil fuels becoming more prevalent, biofuels has become an increasingly attractive alternative. Traditional biofuel production was quickly halted as a result of its ethical complications, leading to the development of secondgeneration biofuels. This system utilizes plant waste instead of food as its starting material, allowing for rapid recycling of this widely available and cheap carbon source. This switch was, however, coupled with complications. Of those, the most prominent is the inevitable release of acetic acid resulting from the breakdown of the lignocellulosic waste. This acetic acid is challenging to neutralize or extract in a scalable manner, leaving it in high concentrations in the substrate fed to the yeast, greatly decreasing their efficiency. To combat that problem, we are implementing an acid resistance system endogenous to E. coli inside of the yeast to impart a similar resistance. The system functions on a cyclopropanation mechanism that decreases the permeability of the membrane to slow the diffusion of the acid into the cell. With this system, in conjunction with other complementary modifications, we look to increase the efficiency of secondgeneration biofuel production bringing it another step closer to playing a prominent role in our energy economy.",

The biggest problems are pervasive advertisements, luck having a significant effect on gameplay results and rewards, and the inability of skilled players to differentiate themselves from mediocre players. BoneHeads aims to avoid these pitfalls. The gameplay involves the management of a small but growing group of skeletal minions, in a fight for survival against the humans that seek to destroy you. The main feature of this gameplay is that your minions do not all behave the same, which increases the complexity of how you keep them efficiently busy. This project included the creation of 3D models, textures, animations, sound effects, music, and gameplay programming. The game is focused on the AI of your minions, but the AI techniques employed are nothing new. I have not yet completed the goal-oriented AI that some of the minions will use, and there are many bugs to fix and features to add before it becomes a marketable game. The most difficult problem I had was the result of not enough abstraction; I got bogged down trying to program the logic of all the targettng variations into the same method. I also found that creating the sounds, music, and graphics gave me much more motivation to work on the programming so that I could witness the fruits of my labors.",

Although many control methods exist for less severely motorly impaired patients, this method would improve quality of life for all patients by allowing for movements to be controlled exclusively using the brain. The three steps for our project were to define the tasks and collect data, process the signals, and run the processed signals through a machine learning algorithm. In addition to the tasks not involving movement, having the subject’s eyes open was required as closing one’s eyes as a control method would not be practical. Different processing techniques were used to prepare the data and extract features for the training of the machine learning model for the classification task. Due to COVID-19, a limited amount of data was collected, resulting in inaccurate classification results. The “imagining-to-move” and “at rest” tasks that we designed for data collection appear to be the most effective when focusing on the mu rhythms at 7 to 12 Hz from the central cortex, but much more data is needed to prove this point. These tasks, brain area, and frequency ranges would be ideal for control method research projects in the future.",

        "abstract": "As networking technologies in the fields of Cloud, Fog, and Edge computing continue to gain popularity and widespread adoption, their contributions to network traffic load and congestion in their respective data processing layers are expected to increase. The implication of this inevitable change is that overall traffic congestion is expected to increase as more devices are connected. As a consequence of this congestion, network performance is expected to decrease, and the best effort nature of network traffic means that there is no guarantee that applications will continue to communicate at rates required for operation. This could prevent certain networking applications from meeting their operational requirements.\n To address this issue, we propose a resource reservation controller to remotely enforce qualities of service in congested networks and provide bandwidth guaran- tees on a per-application basis, improving performance of mission-critical applications. The controller provides an effective abstraction for bandwidth reservation that facilitates the reservation process for end devices. It automates the tedious process of establishing policy-based Quality of Service (QoS) in order to slice bandwidth between different applications. This network controller is shown to effectively find routes through a network that meet minimum bandwidth requirements, remotely configuration network switches, and create reservations for specific TCP flows that- increase available bandwidth for specified network applications.",

However, due to the high cost and laboratory requirements of this procedure, women in low resource settings typically do not have access to this procedure. Since they are not regularly screened and often have little knowledge of cervical cancer, they are unaware of symptoms and physiological changes that mark the progression from human papillomavirus (HPV) infection to cervical cancer. Because of the seemingly benign symptoms of the disease, cervical cancer is the third most common form of cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer related death in women worldwide. There are alternative methods available to detect the presence of high grade lesions in the cervix, but these methods are invasive and difficult to accurately interpret without the presence of a medical professional. Therefore, we are attempting to create a low cost, non-invasive, cancer-specific detection system based on urinalysis biomarker assays.

Both of these procedures require a high degree of healthcare training in order to administer and interpret, and are highly invasive, requiring direct interaction with the cervix. Our alternative procedure utilizes a particular bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum , within the cervicovaginal microbiome that has been associated with cervical cancer pathology. Our screening procedure seeks to identify the need for further diagnostic testing based on a vaginal swab representative of fusobacteria colonization of the vagina. Two modalities, growth media containing colorimetric indicators and a qPCR-based assay, are used to qualitatively and quantitatively measure the presence of this bacteria. This collection method is less invasive and does not require healthcare expertise, therefore allowing for self-administration. Outcomes of testing are measured by determining the feasibility of the prototype regarding sensitivity and parameters of bacterial growth, including time for incubation, the temperature of incubation, and aerobic exposure time. Further testing will include quantifying fusobacteria in a cervical cancer patient sample and establishing exact temperature ranges of incubation and incubation time.",

The signaling patterns that we will investigate are those within and between 3D cancer cell spheroids using cellular communication shuttles called exosomes. We will also incorporate a microfluidic device that will facilitate high-throughput testing in shared conditions, thereby eliminating error due to varying environmental factors. Our research on the signaling differences between 3D and 2D environments will help inform the fundamental questions of tumor biology and will aid physicians and cancer researchers in the treatment and study of disease.",

        "abstract": "Santa Clara University’s new law building, Charney Hall, was constructed in 2018 using steel and concrete, but was redesigned by this team using Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) and Glue- Laminated Timber (glulams). Charney Hall is a non-symmetric, incongruent structure with large open rooms up to 6,000 square feet. Glulams are made of several parallel planks of wood glued together with structural epoxy to obtain higher strength in the longitudinal direction. CLT panels are similar to glulams, but the longitudinal grains of wood planks are oriented in perpendicular layers in order to increase strength along the weak and strong axes of the member. These engineered wood products capture the strength and longevity of steel and concrete while lowering the environmental impact during the manufacturing and construction process, so the purpose of this design was to show the applicability of these materials in the United States. The completion of this design required an understanding of product information and material properties provided by manufacturers such as Structurlam along with an understanding of the fire, seismic, and safety research that a few organizations, such as Portland and Oregon State Universities, have conducted. This structural redesign included the design of the gravity system by way of the glulam beams and columns and the CLT floor diaphragms. It also included the design of CLT shear walls for the lateral system and a few poignant connection designs.",

        "abstract": "Current cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation, though often effective, have adverse side effects due to their relatively untargeted nature. Consequently, healthy cells are damaged or killed along with the cancerous ones. Researchers using recombinant viruses discovered that the protein Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) can target B cells in the blood in order to deliver therapeutic drugs or genes. However, the current cellular or viral carriers carry inherent risks due to their reliance on genetic material. To eliminate these risks, and to make our concept translatable to treat other forms of cancer, we tagged cell secreted nanovesicles, called exosomes, with CAR. CAR protein has been shown to target certain B cells in the blood that are susceptible to cancer. The goal of our project was to create exosomes tagged with CAR to localize to specific B cells. We confirmed that our CAR protein integrated into the exosomal membrane by visualizing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) domain in discrete locations inside the cell. Our isolation of modified CAR exosomes through harvests allow for future research in localization tests and therapeutic application. In future applications, CAR-exosomes can be loaded with drugs or gene therapy and used for targeted treatment of B cell related cancers.",

Thus, the objective of our project is to utilize neural signals from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to develop a machine learning classifier. Since our specific goal is to help those with limited mobility, we are focusing on motion imagery tasks which elicit a specific mu rhythm in the brain wave that occurs over the sensorimotor cortex. Using this principle, we can use EEG recordings of subjects imagining moving their limbs to extract particular features that can be used as motionless commands. The first stage of our project involves identifying a suitable motion imagery data set. This is followed by a pre-processing stage that involves filtering and transforming the signals. After performing necessary processing on our dataset, we train our machine learning model with the goal of developing a classification system in which test data sets can be entered and motion imagery command features can be automatically extracted and eventually utilized for the BCI.",

        "abstract": "Over the past few years, California has been experiencing a severe drought which has induced many of its lakes and rivers to recede to critically low water levels. The drought has also instigated a deficiency of ground water, as the water table throughout California has been reduced to record low levels. In 2014, Governor Jerry Brown passed a bill that mandated 25% reduction in domestic water consumption and even larger restrictions for agricultural uses. If this drought continues in its severity, Governor Brown may be forced to enact new legislation that would have towns recycle their waste water to compensate for the severe lack of hygienic water supplies. Since California’s economy is largely dependent on agriculture, the drought is extremely problematic and so proactive solutions are needed to avoid excess water shortages. California grows food not just for ourselves but for various parts of the nation and the world. Consequently, our inability to adequately produce crops has repercussions felt around the globe. For our project, we have decided to undertake a solution to this problem by designing a water reclamation facility designed to accommodate the town of Woodland, California. Woodland is located in Yolo County and is roughly twenty miles Northwest of Sacramento. It is a midsized town of just over 60,000 residents and is surrounded by farmland. Since Woodland is in a predominantly agricultural community, it may be in peril of having a water shortage or other emergency measures being enacted as a result of the drought. To avoid such a fate, we have decided to design a water reclamation facility so that the water consumed by the townspeople on a daily basis will be recycled and treated to a level suitable for the irrigation of local crops.",

In addition, as climate change worsens, it is expected that the hydrology of the region will not adhere to historical trends. To help solve these issues a climate analysis was conducted for a watershed near the UTR using four global climate models (due to lack of data availability and resources), and a scoured reach of the river was redesigned to restore the historic floodplain. While the climate analysis proved too variable to apply to the design flow, the channel restoration resulted in a stable bank that is resilient under an expected increase in peak flows due to climate change.",

This population is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change which has increased the duration and intensity of droughts and floods. Droughts and floods can destroy an entire season’s harvest, causing sustenance farmers and their families to struggle for food until the next season. In an attempt to mitigate the severe effects of climate change on these farmers and reduce food insecurity in East Africa, the team has designed a small-scale aquaponic farming system that simultaneously grows fish and vegetables. This system is founded on sustainability, as aquaponics uses significantly less water to grow crops than traditional farming, making it more resilient to both severe droughts and floods, the system also does not rely on external fertilizers, and it uses recycled materials as often as possible.\n This aquaponic system was designed for women’s collectives in East Africa who requested help in building a portfolio of projects that they can teach to women in rural East Africa. These women’s organizations work in rural villages throughout Uganda and Kenya to help local women and their families adapt to the changing climate. Currently, their efforts have been focused on improving the quality and supply of water in the villages by constructing latrines, water filters, and rainwater catchment systems.\n During the 2017-2018 academic year, team members designed and built the aquaponic system in Santa Clara, California, then deployed the first prototype in Kampala, Uganda, and trained several of the collective’s leaders how to build and operate the system.",

Four 7-foot walls were constructed and in-plane lateral cyclic loading was applied to create the effects of a COB structure under lateral loading. The results of the full-scale tests are in the process of being incorporated in the entry for COB into the California Residential Code, with a recommendation given for the reinforcing design that performed the best, through allowable load and deflection calculations.

Cob heavily lacks the testing and modern research required for permissible construction under current residential building codes. Further tests involving earthquake and lateral loading are required to implement cob into the California Residential Building Code. In this report, four cob walls, each with different reinforcement mechanisms, were tested to observe their failure modes and find the maximum deflection and load of each wall. Through this testing, it was determined that steel reinforcement within cob walls can provide more ductile behavior and increase both maximum loads and displacement of the material. Analysis showed the ideal reinforced cob wall had an estimated Response Modification Factor of 2.5 which reduces design loads significantly when considering lateral seismic loading. The combination of vertical steel and lateral wire mesh reinforcement throughout a cob wall proved to be the most efficient way to reinforce the structure. The key to properly reinforce cob involves using materials that are large enough to transfer load but small enough to not create large voids within the cob matrix. There is potential for the material to be used in permitted buildings, yet much more full scale research must be done to solidify its capabilities.",

        "abstract": "During summer months there is reliance on air conditioning (A/C), which is energy intensive in nature. The mass use of A/C units during peak hours taxes the energy grid significantly as a demand spike occurs during these peak hours. This demand spike requires an equal response in supply which disproportionately produces greenhouse gas emissions as reserve power plants come online to meet this demand. These reserve power plants, are relatively inefficient, and more expensive to run than base load plants. The Coconut Oil Space Cooler utilizes the latent thermal storage capabilities of phase change materials (PCMs) to provide a temporary alternative cooling solution to A/C during these peak hours. By taking advantage of daily temperature undulations, the Coconut Oil Space Cooler absorbs heat during the day, during peak hours, when the temperature is sufficiently high to melt the phase change material. It absorbs heat from the environment, cooling it in the process. At night when the ambient temperature falls below the melting temperature of the phase change material, the device is operated to solidify the phase change material by releasing the stored heat back into the surroundings. The device is best suited toward a desert climate where day & night temperatures can vary greatly.\n As the name states, the device utilizes coconut oil as the phase change material, two separate heat exchangers, a duct fan, pumps, an Arduino microcontroller, solenoid valves, and various hardware to achieve the cooling effect. The device is able to provide, on average, 1 ℃ cooling effect for about 40 minutes of operation. When the Coconut Oil Space Cooler is operated for a single hour, during peak load hours, for a month, it equates to monetary savings of $50; this is for Bay Area utility rates. Many aspects of the product’s design had areas for improvement and optimization: diameter vs length optimizations for the tube-in-tube heat exchanger would optimize heat transfer rate with total thermal storage capacity. Selecting specialized phase change materials for specific temperature conditions would further improve the efficacy of the device. Additionally, adding fins to improve conduction within the tube-in-tube heat exchanger would improve the heat transfer rate.",

Each candidate peptide was scored based on electrostatic interactions with the target and ranked in order of predicted binding affinity.\n The top hits were then engineered to include an l-DOPA unnatural amino acid as described previously10, which will form a covalent link to the target biomarker upon oxidation. The engineered peptide was then recombinantly expressed and purified from E. coli cell culture. The resulting synthetic antibody achieves target specificity from the peptide backbone and affinity from the covalent cross-linker, which rivals the specificity and affinity of traditional monoclonal antibodies. This technology presents an alternative to monoclonal antibody production, avoiding outsourced and intensive production and quality control.",

Continent intestinal reservoirs have similar side effects and also have a fairly high reintervention rate. These issues inspired us to seek an alternative approach to this treatment. Due to the relative efficiency demonstrated by current ostomy bag treatments, we created a similar, but internal, permanent reservoir to store fecal matter before evacuation. Our product replaces the functions of the large intestine and rectum and significantly improving the overall quality of life for these patients.

        "year": "2019",
        "advisor": "Daniel Lewis",
        "abstract": "There are many people throughout the world who have recently lost an arm and are struggling to learn how to do simple tasks without it. A typical solution to this is to use a prosthetic arm but there is a trade-off between functionality and cost. The most functional options involve expensive, invasive procedures. One solution is to reroute nerves from other places in the body, and another method is to build a socket into the arm, which allows the prosthetic to connect directly to nerves still existing in the arm. With these solutions, a person can simply think about what they want to do, and the prosthetic will do it. Our goal was to improve the existing solutions. By processing electromyography (EMG) signals through a neural network and controlling the prosthetic arm with the output, we hoped to enable a noninvasive prosthetic to become as intuitive and nearly as functional as the more expensive alternative.\n A common type of noninvasive prosthetic is a myoelectric prosthetic, which is controlled using EMG signals. However, the way they are controlled is drastically different than the way anatomically intact arms are controlled. They use indirect motions, such as moving a body part to control the prosthetic. This makes them very complicated to use, especially for people who are still coping with the loss of an arm and trying to control the prosthetic in the same way. To make the transition to a prosthetic as easy as possible and to ensure that the prosthetic is intuitive to use, our control system uses EMG signals collected from the shoulder above the missing limb and natural movements.\n Our control system focused on four motions: opening/closing a hand and extending/contracting an arm. The goal was to accurately categorize the motion in each sample at least 80% of the time. The first step was to collect data. We collected 250 samples of each motion, for a total of 1000 samples. Within each five second EMG recording, the motion began at the two second mark and lasted one full second. Once the data was collected, it was separated into good and bad data, based on the number of heartbeats that occurred. The heartbeat signal was significant compared to the rest of the EMG, and it had to be removed. This was the used to train and test a neural network. The network used, a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN), was designed specifically for data that changes over time. Most of the data was used to train the data and teach it what characteristics were associated with each motion, and then tested the remaining 20% of the data to find the final accuracy.\n Overall, our project succeeded in many ways. Our control system costs slightly more than a quarter than most myoelectric prostheses and with an inexpensive arm, that cost would not be raised much. This arm is controlled with entirely natural movements, which is unlike most myoelectric prostheses and that would make it intuitive. The four motions were included to get successful results. The training accuracy, at 96%, is well over our goal of 80%. The testing accuracy, made smaller by the limiting data set, is at 78.4% and just shy of 80%. With the combination of those two scores, we consider our control system to have met all of our objectives for a control system of a prosthetic arm.",

Over the span of my project I was able to confirm the feasibility of the concept and produce a working prototype. The prototype could allow the absorption chiller to operate for approximately thirty minutes without the need for electricity. It was concluded that a ½ inch, Glycerol thermosyphon, with a 30% working fluid volume fill ratio, could safely provide a viable solution for refrigeration in developing countries that use cook stoves.

One particular building method, using earthbags, has shown promise in performing well against seismic activity. This project undertook the goal of developing a preliminary seismic response modification factor, R, to be used in the design of homes in seismically active areas. Two 4’ wide x 6’ tall x 1’ deep walls were cyclically loaded using a Three-Degree-of-Freedom (TDOF) Test Frame provided by Santa Clara University to determine the in-plane shear capacity of each wall. Testing revealed an average yield force of 419 lbs, an average ultimate force 1058 lbs, and an average R value of 6.\n Wall design and construction was focused on three aspects of the project that were modeled to replicate common building practices while still being modular enough to test multiple samples. These aspects were the base, bond beam, and wall. Wall bases were designed to withstand up to 3500 lb-ft bending moment during forklift transport, the bond beam was designed to transfer up to 9,000 lbs of shear force into the wall, and, the wall was designed using common building practices used in earthbag construction.\n Upon completion of the Consortium of Universities for the Research of Earthquake Engineering (CUREE) testing protocol, it was observed that the walls failed in buckling due to compression resulting from the force couple created by the loading arrangement. Despite failure, the walls continued standing even after the pin connection was removed from the tops of wall. This unexpected resiliency and behavior of the walls during testing led the team to believe that earthbag walls are much more ductile a material that was initially anticipated. A deeper understanding is needed to better understand how earthbag buildings behave against seismic forces. This project is encouraging for future research and the development of a more standardized building method.",

We simulated several different PUF designs on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board to determine how changes to a starting design can affect the reliability, randomness, and uniqueness of these IDs. We propose two schemes, a parallel and a serial scheme for a ring oscillator (RO) based PUF. The parallel scheme is a useful benchmark for other designs, and the serial scheme uses much less hardware than other RO PUF designs. The serial scheme is not as random, reliable, or unique as the parallel scheme, but it creates input-output pairs with much less area.",

        "abstract": "The adoption of solar power technologies throughout the world is increasing rapidly. Solar trackers are a necessary component in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) applications and have also shown up to 46% per annum energy increase in photovoltaic (PV) panels when compared with fixed mounted panels. To resist wind forces, trackers typically incorporate heavy structural components and reinforced concrete foundations. Thus, the manufacture and installation of trackers is costly due to their size, weight, and careful consideration of geological conditions. This work presents a new solar tracker design for use with concentrating solar power and photovoltaic panels. The tracker is comprised of two coplanar perpendicular linear actuators and one linkage arm that can track the sun in two axes. A hybrid control strategy combines time and location based solar position estimates, with a two-axis misalignment sensor for a robust control strategy. Part cost is lowered by the low profile tracker geometry by allowing lighter structural and actuation components to combat gusty conditions, and installation costs are reduced by the wide footprint of the system, mitigating the need for deep foundations. A tracker prototype is built and tested for functionality and tracking accuracy. Testing shows an average mechanical pointing hysteresis of 0.05 [degrees]. The tracker is outfitted with a parabolic mirror and blackbody receiving cavity, and in full sun reaches a steady-state temperature of 670 [degrees] C.",

        "advisor": "Steven Chiesa",
        "abstract": "The problem of arsenic contamination affects millions of people worldwide. A home-scale arsenic removal system could provide families in Nepal access to clean drinking water. It would also reduce the risk of adverse health issues that are associated with ingesting arsenic contaminated water. Our experiments show that using electrocoagulation is an effective method of removing arsenic from water. We were able to get the level of arsenic below 10 ppb in 60 minutes of treatment using various system configurations. We identified several parameters that affect the treatment process, the most important being the charge loading, or the amount of charge that passes through the solution during treatment. The more current supplied, the faster the treatment, but too much current is inefficient. We identified an effective range for charge loading to be between 150 and 180 C/L. For a home-scale arsenic removal system to be used in Nepal, we recommend using a 6V rechargeable battery supplying 170 C/L of charge to a 3.5 gallon bucket (13L) and a electrochemical cell which consists of five 4\"x4\" steel plates. Water treated in the first stage then moves to a sand filter containing 10 inches of fine sand and a simple underdrain nozzle. The water will then be stored in a large container. With the battery constraint reduced or removed, the system can be upgraded to a larger treatment system or even an automated semi-continuous flow system. The design of this removal system is manufacturable, but is dependent upon the identification of a local manufacturer to maintain low cost. A manufacturer can be identified after field testing to observe the system's performance in the intended environment is completed.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic circuits provide novel ways for scientists to program and probe mammalian cell behavior. This allows for enhanced research tools and chemical sensors. Our project works with an engineered synthetic circuit and monitors the output of the circuit using green fluorescent protein( GFP) and luciferase. Expression of GFP is both quantifiable and observable over a time period in living cells. Luciferase can be detected by an assay in lysed cells to give data on overall expression of the circuit. By measuring and comparing output of this circuit over time, we can create a model to demonstrate the lack of expression, minimal expression, and maximum expression of the circuit. Our dual reporter system can be adapted to give detailed information on various promoter elements of synthetic circuits.\n This dual reporter system was designed to monitor s ignal pathways within mammalian cells. Signal pathways are a complex and dynamic interconnected web of protein expression. Methods to monitor these pathways en vivo poses a challenge due to lack of noninvasive reporting systems in desired cell models. The use of a dualreporter system with expression of GFP and firefly luciferase allows for the assessment of signal transduction with resulting data sets of overall intensity and temporality in realtime. Neither light emitting marker could show these two properties alone. To demonstrate this system and establish a scale of expression, we transformed mammalian HEK cells with a vector coding for the dual reporter. The transformed cell lines were monitored via fluorescent microscopy and luciferase assays. Our findings show successful basal level expression of synthetic circuit dualreporter system both qualitatively and quantitatively in a way that neither reporter protein could achieve alone. Our system can successfully deliver this data type and can be an effective tool for cell signal pathway expression.",

This project served as an opportunity to design, manufacture, test, and scale a product using knowledge obtained through various coursework. In applying a propulsion system familiar for a high number of users to a watercraft more stable than many other watercraft options, this project also sought to give people previously restricted to land an opportunity to experience watersports in a manner that is comfortable for them. The addition of the hydrofoil to the watercraft planned to provide an additional, innovative dimension to the watercraft designed to increase the overall performance of the system. Our design team was responsible for engineering the flotation, propulsion, steering, and lift systems of the watercraft. Given our initial design, our team expected the hydrofoils to generate 313 lb. of lift at a speed of 3.5 mph, thereby having the capability to lift a 50 lb. watercraft with 250 lb. rider out of the water. Our final prototype, however, weighed 100 lb, only achieved a maximum speed of 2 mph, and was unable to generate the lift required to lift the watercraft out of the water at the top speed. As a result, the incorporation of the hydrofoils produced minimal lift and resulted in additional drag on our system, thereby reducing our expected top speed of 3.5 mph without the hydrofoils and 7 mph with the hydrofoils, to a maximum system speed of 2 mph. The manufactured pontoons were 8 ft long with a 1ft x 1ft cross section and they each support 321 lbs thus achieving our safety and stability goals.",

Presently, methane gas is too costly and dangerous to convert to methanol. The direct oxidation of methane can reduce the processing and transportation costs creating a competitive alternative to petroleum. This device will be marketable to companies interested in alternative fuel sources competitive with petroleum. Entrepreneurs are then expected step in and develop a global market. With the development of our prototypes and running methane and oxygen (or atmospheric oxygen) through the systems, we were able to detect the presence of methanol. We worked with a porous ceramic pot, two tanks and pressure regulators for oxygen and methane, an ignition system, and a device that contained this experiment. Due to the volatile nature of the chemical reaction between the two gasses, three prototypes were designed. By varying the experimental parameters of time length of the reaction, voltage, gas flow rate, and pressure, we were able to draw conclusions for what the optimal criterion are for interacting the gasses. More specifically, running the experimental reaction for 2 minutes, setting a voltage of 14 volts (V), exposing the system to a pressure of 20 hertz (Hz) all contributed to the testing the methanol samples. Using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy analysis, we observed methanol peaks, intermediate formaldehyde peaks, and methanol dimer peaks, successfully accomplishing the goal of this project. By changing certain parameters for future experimentation and then testing the outcomes, the device can be modified to produce the cleanest methanol that can be used to power technologies that are used today. Using this device to spur the adoption of methanol as an alternative energy resource can conserve our existing petroleum reserves, increase competition among energy providers, and reduce cost. Also since methanol burns cleaner than petroleum-based fuels, developing automobiles, transportation, and power generation using methanol can grow existing technology companies, most likely start new ones, and deliver environmental benefits.",

        "advisor": "Hohyun Lee",
        "abstract": "Lack of safe food storage can lead to sickness, cancer, and even death. This has effects on developing communities where over a billion people live without access to electricity. This lack of electrical power limits families in developing communities’ ability to utilize modern refrigeration systems, forcing them to instead rely on ice boxes to keep their food cold. Ice boxes are a time consuming refrigeration system that can be highly inconsistent and unsafe, if not constantly monitored. Simply, poor food storage can lead to illness and systemic problems caused by poor diet. In order to combat this problem, we are developing an off-grid, low power, compact refrigeration system with a user interface to allow for greater individual control. By optimizing thermoelectric modules with regards to the refrigerator size and heat dissipation system, it is possible to achieve a temperature difference suitable for storing food at power levels lower than that of a standard light bulb. The cooling system is further enhanced using an evaporative cooling solution that is rigorously designed to provide the greatest cooling effect with minimal user interaction. When used in conjunction with the main thermoelectric heat pump, lower internal temperatures can be achieved at reduced power. This system performance is monitored and controlled using a micro-controller that measures environmental conditions as well as fridge performance. It can inform the user and allow them a greater amount of control over the performance of their refrigeration system. In summary, we seek to effectively design a product that will enhance the quality and safety of life for those without access to reliable refrigeration.",

        "abstract": "Culturing neurons in vitro is a challenging task because they are a highly specialized cell type that reside in a complex and unique environment in the body. The aim of the research presented in the following thesis was to design a biomimetic, three-dimensional scaffold capable of (1) promoting primary neuron maturation and axonal outgrowth and (2) serving as a system for toxicology screening. In the system presented here, neurons were cultured in three-dimensional hydrogels, simulating the physiological environment that these cells experience within the body. In doing so, a biologically relevant response was elicited upon their exposure to acrylamide, a known neurotoxin. Primary neurons were isolated from embryonic chick spinal cords and seeded in alginate or collagen hydrogels. Initial cell viability assays and qualitative microscopy observations confirmed that primary neurons not only survive in the system, but also exhibit positive axon growth. Next, neuronal response to acrylamide was evaluated through cytotoxicity assays and axon outgrowth measurement through immunocytochemistry. The study of neurotoxic effects on neuron maturation in collagen gels yielded two key observations: (1) the level of cell death in neurons exposed to acrylamide is dependent on the density and availability of attachment proteins in the collagen hydrogel environment and (2) the axonal retraction response is more sensitive to acrylamide than the lethal cellular response is. The ability of the collagen scaffold to provide insight into neuronal response to toxin in a biomimetic, three-dimensional environment suggests the system’s potential for increasing the accuracy of early stage cytotoxicity testing for safe and efficient pharmaceutical candidates. Additionally, this research has further implications in neurodegenerative disease modeling, spinal cord injury recovery studies, and basic research in neuroscience and neural tissue engineering.",

These devices not only have a wide variety of processors and implementations, but they often serve different purposes and generate unique network traffic. Current IoT network security solutions fail to account for and handle both the scale at which IoT devices can be deployed and the heterogeneous nature of the traffic they produce. In order to accommodate these differences and improve on current solutions, we propose the implementation of a microsegmented firewall for IoT networks. Unlike traditional microsegmented architectures, which use a virtual management layer and hypervisors to manage, route, and filter the traffic from VMs, we propose the use of a cloud based management layer working in cooperation with fog node filters to manage end device traffic. The fog nodes act as the first hop from the IoT devices, filtering traffic according to the rules given to them by the management layer. This decreases packet filtering latency by distributing the computing load and limiting the number of hops packets make for processing. Meanwhile, having a singular management point gives network administrators the convenience of controlling all traffic flows at a moments notice as would be the case in a traditional SDN. As a result, this architecture promotes both the adaptability and scalability needed in IoT networks, all while securing traffic flows and minimizing latency.",

While some chemical structures are known, some of the most scientifically intriguing perfluorinated oils and surfactants do not have their chemical structures or characteristics available to the public research community. During the course of our senior design project, we isolated one particular perfluorinated oil and surfactant mixture and performed a number of tests on the stability of the emulsions over a variety of different biologically relevant variables. To achieve this, we were required to design multiple iterations of droplet-microfluidic chips to create the simplest emulsions for study. The resulting designs gave us an excellent platform to study not only our emulsion system, but many future emulsions systems in a novel manner. We proved its efficacy by using the system to show great variance in the stability and surface energy of different pH droplets in QX100 perfluorinated oil with surfactant as well as a characterizable change in stability when changing the concentration of phosphate and media constituents in the droplets. Finally, we further analyzed the emulsion with the help of Dr. Gerald Fuller’s coalescence lab in Stanford University’s CHEM department and observed changes in the viscoelastic nature of aqueous-perfluorinated oil interfaces over a variety of biologically relevant conditions. Though much was accomplished, there is still a need to further characterize both more aqueous conditions and more perfluorinated systems to truly shed light on the field. Additionally, more detailed viscoelastic analysis needs to be performed on these new conditions and oil-surfactant mixtures as well as a thorough pendant-drop style surface tension experiment on all experiments performed.",

        "abstract": "Photovoltaic panels are fundamental in the generation of renewable energy both on a local scale and a utility scale. The mounting systems for such panels can be costly, require large amounts of maintenance, and miss out on energy savings. Manual cleaning and single axis tracking systems leave more to be desired from such systems. In this paper, we propose, research, test and manufacture a two axes solar tracking system with integrated water cleaning to obtain the most energy savings possible from a single PV panel. Our work shows that two axis tracking combined with an automated cleaning system can provide more energy savings compared to a fixed panel system requiring manual cleaning. We have shown technical feasibility of a two axis tracking system as well as demonstrated simple design, testing, and construction of a water based cleaning system using a small water pump and PVC piping. As a result of such manufacturing and in order to improve efficiency, it is our future recommendation to integrate water and electrical home connections, create a customer experience mobile or web based application, and complete large scale long term testing.",

The project scope includes design of the movable span superstructure and determination of pile depth and capacity. This project only concerns replacing the existing movable span. The movable span for the bridge will be replaced with 3 static spans and a rolling bascule bridge. The length of the center span that will be removed is 318ft and will be replaced by the rolling bascule bridge with a length of 150ft. The remaining space would be replaced by the 3 static spans. This project will include member selection for the Rolling Bascule Bridge superstructure, considering dead, live, and impact loads from the railroad deck, rail traffic, and self-weight of the superstructure, including the counterweight. The design method used is the Load Resistance Factor Design method as described in the American Institute of Steel Construction Manual. The static spans have been designed to determine the area of steel needed only to determine weights for the foundations. Foundation designs were completed using the Allowable Stress Design method. The foundations comprise of a pile cap and a pile group. Pile capacity was determined using local boring log and vane shear testing data. Two different pile caps were designed to meet the two major foundation load conditions, referred to as the Counterweight Side and the Non-Counterweight Side.",

        "abstract": "In the United States, a significant portion of landfill is undiverted compost and recyclable material. Instead of being sent to landfills, compostable material can be used as nutrient rich fertilizer and soil in local communities. Likewise, recyclable material can be processed at appropriate facilities to reuse materials and reduce the demand for unsustainable resources, like plastics. We seek to reduce the portion of undiverted recyclable and compostable waste by aiding in the proper sorting of waste at common sites of disposal, particularly trash cans in cafeterias and restaurants. We have designed a mobile, augmented reality, 3D object detection model that utilizes a Convolutional Neural Networks to detect and classify waste in real time. The model distinguishes between landfill waste, recyclable material, and compostable material, corresponding to the common categories of existing sorting bins.\n With our initial research, we found several other projects that developed similar systems to solve similar issues as us. CompostNet [1] and SpotGarbage [2] also applied machine learning algorithms to identify waste through mobile devices. However, these solutions are limited by their categories and user interaction. SpotGarbage is only capable of detecting one category of waste within photos, and thus cannot be used for a waste sorting and diversion problem. While CompostNet could detect multiple different classes of waste, such as trash, recycling, and compost, their system only works with images featuring singular objects. As a result, users have to manually take an image, then await results on what their picture was.\n Our solution utilizes an object detection algorithm to allow users to classify their waste in real time. Users only need to hold up their waste in front of the camera and bounding boxes are drawn over their waste. The advantage of this system is that users do not need to interact with the mobile device to take a photo, and thus can quickly and efficiently sort their waste. Additionally, with bounding boxes, we can be more specific about what is waste, rather than classifying an entire photo as ”recycling”. The final advantage of our mobile application lies with the ability to classify multiple objects. CompostNet has little practical usage, as users would not hold up their trash one at a time. However, with our solution, users could hold up a whole tray of trash, food, and recyclable items, and they would be appropriately identified. With the introduction of our Augmented Reality Glasses System, we provide even more flexibility and use case. Users no longer need to point phones at their trash, instead, simply looking at trash would detect it. While AR Glasses are currently pricey and unwieldy, we believe that in the future they will become more lightweight and integrated with our current devices. By incorporating them into our solution, we prepare for a more technologically advanced future. Overall, we have expanded upon previous solutions to create a more practical and flexible solution. Our solution was capable of a mean average precision of .863 on our testing dataset, and an average inference time of 59.98 ms, indicating that it is relatively effective at detecting and categorizing different waste objects.",

In this work, we propose an edge-to-fog computing framework for object detection from surveillance videos. Videos are captured locally at an edge device and sent to fog nodes for colorassisted L1-subspace background modeling. The results are then sent back to the edge device for data fusion and final object detection. Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed color-assisted background modeling offers more diversity than pure luminance based background modeling and hence achieves higher object detection accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed edge-to-fog paradigm leverages the computing resources on multiple platforms. [1]",

Further complicating the development of NPs for biomedical applications, disease states alter the population of proteins and changes the biophysical features of individual proteins through posttranslational modifications. Here-in, we aim to understand how glycation of the PC, as in uncontrolled diabetes, alters the NP-PC interaction and toxicity by conducting biochemistry and cell toxicity experiments. We focus upon 40 and 80 nm citrate-coated silver nanoparticles and glycated and unmodified human serum albumin (HSA) as a model system. To investigate the impact of glycation on NP-PC interactions, we evaluate changes to NP size and surface charge, HSA secondary structure, and binding constants for the complex. Results indicate a stable system with no particle agglomeration or protein unfolding, an increase in surface charge, and dynamic binding. To investigate the impact of the PC and glycation on NP interactions with human cells, we investigate changes in proliferation of HepG2 cells with addition of the complex. Results indicate the protein corona increases the cytotoxicity of the NPs. Results will contribute to the body of research exploring how nanoparticles change when they enter human systems. In the long term this research will assist in developing NPs for medical applications, especially in a diabetic population.",

While such microswimmers do not yet exist for use on patients, many researchers are working on this front to make them a reality. One of the main challenges in making these microswimmers a reality is creating propulsion in a low Reynolds number environment. This project aims to create and test a prototype of a swimmer which employs 3D circular movement of its tail for propulsion in a very viscous fluid, mimicking a low Reynolds environment in the macroscale. To create a successful proof of concept of 3D circular propulsion, simulations, prototyping, and experimental evaluation of the prototype were conducted during the course of this project. Finite element analysis using the commercial software COMSOL was conducted to design a swimmer tail that would generate a positive thrust force, and a velocity at an order of magnitude consistent with the analytical prediction. Guided by the simulation results, a prototype was fully realized, and testing was conducted resulting in a speed of 0.5 mm/s, which matched with the order of magnitude of the speed obtained from the simulations. The data collected from testing accompanied by simulations confirmed our proof of concept. Lastly, additional simulations were performed to find optimal parameters that can be implemented in the swimmer design for future testing. In essence, this report will provide an overview of the design, construction, and testing of a scaled-up experimental platform to examine the principle of elastic propulsion in highly viscous fluid.",

        "abstract": "The electric hydrofoil community has become very popular in recent years with its two major subsections being divided up into those that buy their boards commercially and those that build their own (the DIY community). The commercial boards are extremely expensive and can reach prices of over $12,000. This is the root cause of the rapidly growing DIY community who can build functioning boards for around $3000. Reducing this entry cost has made the sport much more accessible to new members and has allowed both the size of the community and awareness of the sport to increase. For this report the DIY community was analyzed for weak points and major issues or hurdles that they may face. This exposed major safety concerns, and R&D issues as the community lacked the resources and knowledge to solve since each DIY board is a unique build with unique issues. Often, E-Foil boards are built in the fastest manner possible with the cheapest components, adhering to the strict goal of creating an operational device. This creates large gaps in safety for these DIY builds often ignored in favor of speed, battery life, or pricing. Examples of this negligence are, sub-par battery waterproofing, implementing propellers with no duct leaving an exposed blade spinning at several thousand RPM, and potentially utilizing materials that can be dangerous or un-optimized for water sport use. Using Solidworks fluid flow simulations, a duct and propeller system was created that was able to retain 94% of the efficiency of a ductless system while boasting a 30% increase over the open-source duct and propeller used by the community. This explains why the open-source duct is often removed since riders would be experiencing only about 60%-65% of the efficiency as they would without it. To confirm a proof of concept, the designs generated through the duct optimization iteration process were then live tested in water. The results showed that a bad duct design can be dramatically more inefficient creating a device that no longer functions in the water or it can be so efficient that the difference between ducted and un-ducted propeller setups have nearly no noticeable change to the rider’s experience. This report outlines these issues in greater detail, explain how they were solved or mitigated, with the importance of making the findings reproduceable within the community. Further recommendations include iterating on the propeller design to find the optimal E-foil propeller, while referencing back to the duct to ensure the new prop does not require another redesigned duct. This could be iterated any number of times in searching for the best duct-propeller combination.",

Although monitoring and studying the energy consumption of these devices is essential, the use of external, hardware-based energy measurement tools is costly, non-scalable, and introduces many challenges regarding the connectivity of such tools with devices. In this thesis, we propose EMT, a novel tool to collect, analyze, and monitor the power cycles of IoT devices without the need for any external tools. The basic idea is to modify the WiFi Access Point's software to keep track of the power status of devices reported in packets. EMT also includes back-end and front-end components for data storage, analysis, and visualization. We demonstrate the effectiveness and features of EMT via empirical evaluations.",

With a primary focus on the development of the cell encapsulation device (CED) Encellin sponsored this thesis to create a standardized mode of implantation for the CED. The objective is to to design a low-cost, effective, and minimally invasive surgical implant delivery system for implantation of the CED. Being that Encellin’s product is a novel technology, there are few competitive devices found on the market. With that in mind, the team designed three unique delivery system models to be rapidly prototyped, guaranteeing that an efficient product development timeline was maintained. In this paper, the design process that led to the development and testing of numerous 3D printed models is discussed. Once a standardized testing protocol was developed, testing was conducted on each prototype. For future considerations, the finalized prototype dimensions can be slimmed down to meet a more minimally invasive requirement. Additionally, further development can be made on the mechanical components of the system to assure better functionality. This can be done by optimizing the way parts fit together to ensure that they move more efficiently. Given more time and better access to 3D printing technology or injection molding, the final prototype can be made to better prioritize its minimally invasive aspect by allowing for smaller dimensions all around.",

Many algorithms taught in this class for predicting and measuring energy usage are dependent on the weather. For example, to predict energy usage for an upcoming day, if the day is predicted to have a max temperature of eighty degrees and a minimum temperature of fty- ve degrees, students can look in historical databases of weather for days that have similar weather, and infer that the energy usage might be similar as well. Energy usage prediction methods such as this one that involve numerous database lookups are fairly accurate, but extremely time consuming to calculate. Currently, if a student enrolled in the class is solving a problem that requires this \\similar day\" algorithm, he/she has to obtain a historical weather database, and compare the upcoming day they are trying to calculate the energy usage for with the rst day in the database. Then he/she compares it with the second day, etc. This process is extremely tedious, and provides almost no educational utility to the student. If the student wants to check his/her work, he/she would have to do the calculations all over again. These large repetitive tasks are extremely ine ciently done by humans, but can be done extremely rapidly by a computer. At the moment, students in the class use historical databases that contain one week of data, because of the amount of time it takes to perform lookups and comparisons. However, for a computer, it would be trivial to perform hundreds or even thousands of lookups and comparisons in a matter of seconds. The solution is to create a web application that has access to all of the required historical databases, and performs all of the comparisons automatically. The application will take as input an upcoming day and predicted weather parameters, and search through its databases for the most similar day, and return the predicted energy usage. This will alleviate the tedium for the students, allowing them to focus on the actual ideas behind the methods used and why they work. The logic behind the algorithm will be extremely portable, and could be easily adapted to other methods that are used in the ELEN 288 / COEN 282, or even other classes in the Sustainable Energy Program, such as predicting power generation from solar panels or wind farms in ELEN 282 or ELEN 286. The web application will be simple and user friendly, and will reduce stress, tedium, and human error that arise from having to perform these calculations manually.",

We chose to utilize exosomes for their longer half-life in the body, better penetrative capacity, and biocompatibility, thus improving upon previous RA treatments. To do this, we created a stable cell line to produce exosomes modified at the surface to express a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), which possesses the ability to act as a decoy and soak up soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), a notable cytokine responsible for inducing inflammation. Exosomes were then harvested from this cell line and characterized with various imaging techniques to confirm that our desired modifications had been made. Then we tested the efficacy of our experiment in two models: direct treatment and coculture. Both models showed decreased levels of inflammation with the addition of our modified, treatment exosomes. If proven to be clinically successful, this therapy has the potential to be the first ever exosome decoy treatment.",

Here, we describe the development of a de novo method to produce genetically modified exosomes with switchable targeting ability and easier isolation capacity. We have elected to fuse an exosome-anchoring protein, vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein (VSVG), with a peptide neoepitope (PNE) short-chain variable fragment (scFV) and a StrepTag region. The PNE-scFV will allow for switchable targeting while the Strep-tag will allow for enhanced purification abilities. We have shown that living human cells can produce the engineered exosomes, and we have isolated the engineered exosomes from producer cells. Post isolation, we have characterized these modified exosomes, and we have begun testing the functionality of the PNE scFV and StrepTag regions.

Many of the traditional methods of studying cell migration, using two-dimensional (2D) platforms, only study two-dimensional migration, which is fundamentally different and more multifaceted than the three-dimensional migration that occurs in vivo. To more accurately capture this in vivo variation, we developed a two-and-a-half-dimensional (2.5D) cell culture platform to better study three-dimensional (3D) migration. This platform consists of a layer of alginate on top of a monolayer of cells grown on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). To test the parameters of the system, experimentation on Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293T cell lines, and linked the 2.5D platform with attachment-independent amoeboid migration. U87 glioblastoma cell line proved to migrate using similar mechanisms, and was used to test anti-metastatic drug candidates. Axitinib, a current chemotherapy drug, blocked migration through pure alginate. Additionally, Cilengitide, a failed anti-metastatic drug candidate, was shown to increase migration in pure alginate. When attachment-mediated migration was induced, Cilengitide did not halt migration, but rather caused the cells to switch to an attachment-independent mechanisms, which corroborates with Phase II Food and Drug Administration (FDA) trials in which Cilengitide failed to stop metastasis. In the study of cancer metastasis, this platform can thus be used to not only to explain the failure of past clinical trials, but also to discover new anti-metastatic drug candidates.",

We will use CD24 and CD47 “don't eat me signals” that have been identified as key mediators of macrophage phagocytosis and apply chemical transfection to target them to the exosome pathway. We also test a tVSVG scaffold to boost the membrane targeting potential of these two proteins to increase the density of CD24 or CD47 proteins on the exosomal surface.

The devastation that occurs from a disaster is much greater in low-resourced regions of the world.\n Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are commonly used to assist first responders during disaster response.

Additionally, our system capitalizes on the functional drawbacks of the current solutions. It is more modular, allowing for a single UAV to be used in a variety of disasters, and it boasts the capability of real-time computer vision. Most importantly, our system can be recreated for one-eighth the cost of a consumer alternative with similar functionality.

Wheelchairs help people with limited mobility transport themselves to different locations, but do not help the person leave the wheelchair. Users would need to do this to enter a car, use the restroom, take a shower, and sit at a table comfortably with family. The following design is a wheelchair attachment that serves to provide the user with increased mobility and independence. Wheelchair users struggle to get into and out of their chairs due to the unassisted distance from the sitting to standing position and the obstruction of the chair body. Caregivers who help to lift the user risk hurting themselves. The purpose of this wheelchair modification is to help the user stand, access other supporting platforms, provide them with independence, and protect caregivers from injury. An analysis of current solutions and wheelchair user input helped to identify a gap in the field and reveal a need for a low cost, high functionality wheelchair attachment. This design incorporates a motorized seat lifting mechanism to assist in straightening the user’s legs to a standing position through user controls. The seat also tilts forward to support them from behind and allow them to gently place their feet on the ground. A sliding mechanism slides the seat forward away from the body of the wheelchair to reach beds, other chairs, or a commode, for example. The seat rotates in order to orient the person in the proper position for transfer to other surfaces. The armrests are detachable to allow the user to move freely between surfaces. All modalities, including the lifting, tilting, sliding, rotating, and armrest mechanisms are reversible and help to get the person back into their wheelchair. Feedback from potential users and caregivers on a video demonstrating the functions was very positive. All respondents said they were very likely to use each functionality independently and the device as whole with the exception of the tilting function which users felt would be unsafe. Overall, every respondent said this device would save caretakers from injury and would make the wheelchair user more independent.",

About one-third of clinical trials exhibit erroneous data, showing intermittent malfunction of the patch in the system. The focus of this senior design project is decoding these erroneous readings due to the patch and proposing possible solutions.\n This senior design project took the form of a design of diagnostic experiments, culminating in a mathematical model that synthesized all of the phenomena we uncovered through experimentation.",

        "abstract": "The agricultural industry is responsible for feeding over 7 billion humans, but even as it serves so many, companies in the agricultural sector are suffering from a labor shortage. Traina Foods is one such company that deals in the manufacturing of dried fruit, producing millions of pounds of fruit each year. They are, however, rapidly becoming unprofitable as the costs of labor rise. Following a visit to one of their farms, the ESPR (Electric Stacking and Placement Robot) was ideated to reduce their reliance on manual labor for the labor-intensive tasks of stacking and placing trays of fruit. In this paper, we detail the design for a robot that can manipulate several trays of fruit more safely and efficiently than a human. We created the CAD assembly for a prototype and performed analyses to ensure that performance specs could be hit reliably throughout the life cycle of the project. Testing was also performed on full-scale motors and controllers to show that control of the various actuators of the ESPR was feasible. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the construction of the prototype will have to be completed by a future group, and technical revisions on tray alignment will have to be tested. The robot will also have to be redesigned to incorporate autonomous navigation features and mobility. We believe that the work done this year shows that the concept of the ESPR is feasible, and further work will yield functional results in the field.",

        "abstract": "One of the common problems with social networking is the ability to plan out an event. Many applications available today simply provide for a broad or narrow audience of invitees. These tools also have the additional problem of being flooded with spam, and content with little interest to its users. To remedy this issue, we devised a new tool, Eventify. Eventify is an Android based application that potentially will make creating events and bringing groups of people together more feasible. We built this application with two main design constraints in mind: The application runs solely via text messaging, without a centralized database and also without use of the internet. In this paper, we researched into the functionality and the architecture of this application, as well as test results and the development process of the application. Our implementation of the application shows that creating a social-based system architecture is possible without use of the internet or use of a centralized database, which is unique to our application. We created a self-sustaining application that can run without support or maintenance costs, provided that all involved users have an Android device and/or text messaging capabilities. The application itself is presented in a straightforward manner; functionality of the application is apparent, and there is no excess flashiness in the application. The application relies on file storage within the phone itself to function: the text files created and handled by the application, however, are lightweight and typical use of the application takes up no more than 1MB of space on the device. Eventify is a lightweight, decentralized application that makes event planning and friendly gatherings less troublesome to handle. While there are solutions that have been created for the purpose of event planning, Eventify was successfully implemented to require no support or maintenance costs and run solely via text messaging.",

One of the major issues these drugs face is the ability to enter a cell or the area of treatment. The current methods for drug delivery are often arduous to complete and do not make it to the diseased area because they are targeted by the immune system. In order to improve the ability for drugs to reach the desired area we propose the use of exosomes. Exosomes are subcellular vesicles that are responsible for the transport of biomaterials or signals within the cell and to other cells. The size of exosomes is small, around 30 nanometers is the average size, which minimizes the potential for immune targeting and also allows them to cross the blood brain barrier. In this project we look at the ability to tag, or add a protein, to the surface of an exosome. The fluorescent protein illustrates the location of the exosome within the cell and its potential to be tagged with other proteins to target various types of cells. Engineering exosomes has the potential to solve the current issues with drug delivery.",

Thus, we developed a new treatment for preventing inflammation: TNF-receptors anchored onto exosome surfaces. Exosomes are nanovesicles that are naturally secreted by most of the cells in our bodies. The many benefits of using exosomes include non-immunogenicity, natural stability in the body, and non-invasiveness. We have demonstrated that exosome membrane bound TNF-receptors have the ability to prevent inflammation in mammalian cells.

        "abstract": "Today, artificial intelligence is used to solve problems as varied as driving cars to diagnosing diseases. However, it still has major pitfalls. The most common form of AI today, machine learning, can produce near-certain predictions for some tasks, yet completely fail at a related but different task. Additionally, such algorithms cannot do reasoning for complex problems, are not well explainable, require massive training datasets, and are sensitive to new data.\n One solution to these problems is combining today’s cutting-edge neural networks with an older idea in AI: symbolic AI. Such so-called “neuro-symbolic AI” systems can be understood at a high level as using a neural network as the “sensory cortex” and a question answering system as the “prefrontal cortex” to do reasoning. Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) has already been shown to excel at visual question answering (VQA), a task that involves answering a question about something happening in an image. Historically, neural networks have been particularly weak in this area. Researchers are just beginning to explore the power of neuro-symbolic AI in approaching video VQA to learn physical dynamics. In the future, such algorithms may play a role in making more flexible and intelligent AI, such as for autonomous driving systems.\n Right now, neuro-symbolic AI has many areas for expansion across a wide range of applications. This paper will seek to apply NSAI to strategic gameplay where agents have the same information a human player has—just an image. To enable testing abstraction and high-level reasoning, I develop the Blokboi game as an AI training and testing tool. Blokboi pushes an AI agent to learn relationships that strain machine learning, and provide an environment in which the AI can be tested for their ability to learn compound interpretation and reasoning. This research expands the applications of NSAI, bringing hybrid artificial intelligence increasingly close to real-world scenarios.",

The city also has an app called San Jose Clean, through which people can report graffiti by taking a photo with their phone, but graffiti is the only problem it deals with and the app is managed by the graffiti removal company so the city has limited access. In response, we created an app citizens can use to report a variety of issues with city property and which the city itself can directly control. By creating a database for all of the information submitted through the app, our solution can help the city sort through the reports and prioritize based on that data, allowing them to address these issues as efficiently as possible. Information on these issues can be available to citizens so that they can volunteer to help fix problems as well.

Simulations of laminar flow and particle tracing through the 3D-printed microneedle device pre-puncture were generated using COMSOL Multiphysics software. These results established a robust flow profile for fluid flow and encapsulated cell tracing through the device when operating in optimal conditions. Next various failure modes were analyzed to determine their effects on the flow profile. Tip deformation, nozzle clogging, and suction were modelled using COMSOL, and respective provisions were added to a failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) matrix. In future experiments, the generated flow patterns may be used as a machine learning data training set to implement an algorithm that recognizes and predicts failure modes based on flow profiles.

The project was inspired by conversations with an aspiring local sunflower farmer who shared some of the difficulties of entering the market as a small business and transporting harvested sunflowers to stores. Our refrigeration and heat treatment system is designed to increase the shelf life of cut flowers, adding several days to get the flowers to market. Through our design process, we used preliminary experiments, calculations, and SolidWorks simulations to inform our subsystem design and selection. The refrigeration system can be divided up into the following subsystems: an A/C unit controlled by an Arduino and temperature sensors, and the insulated frame of the general structure. The heat treatment system consists of a submersible pump, a storage tank, and a layer of insulation to minimize the amount of heat transfer in the system. The heat treatment bath extends the life of the flowers as they are more able to absorb the hot water than cut flowers. The heated water expands the xylem tubes in the stems and more water is drawn in than otherwise would be. This water is then held in the flower for a longer period of time due to the refrigeration system slowing down the respiration rate of the flowers. This system nets two times longer shelf life than just refrigeration alone. The hot water storage will be heated via the excess heat produced from the A/C unit using a radiator. Our system is capable of reaching and maintaining our target refrigeration temperature of 40˚F and 90˚F for our warm water bath. After construction, our total expenditures amounted to $1800, up to three times lower than other walk-in fridges on the market. Furthermore, our system has a shorter payback period and integrates heat treatment and cold storage for flowers. This project was the successful culmination of nine months of hard work and demonstrates our ability to design, construct, and test a functional flower preservation system.",

The stove is developed specifically for developing communities in Nicaragua that still use traditional cooking methods which contribute to premature deaths due to respiratory illness. The designed product is a cylindrical cooking device that has a unique air flow system which optimizes the gasification process. Gasification is the process in which gas released from the primary combustion of biomass is reignited, creating a more complete combustion and thus reducing harmful emissions compared to a traditional wood fire. From testing with a previous design team’s prototype, observations were made which led to the implementation of an air flow system which could be regulated manually. The air flow regulator is a mechanical attachment that allows users to adjust the air flow in the stove to prolong the gasification process; this modification helps the stove maintain gasification throughout usage, and resulted in an 8% reduction of particulate matter in the stove’s exhaust compared to the most recent design.",

The product has been designed for developing areas in Nicaragua where power is inaccessible and a multi-purpose cookstove/phone charger could be of use. The cookstove features a cylindrical combustion chamber that can be used for gasification. Gasification is a burning process where smoke from the fire is also burned, creating higher temperatures and a cleaner burn. The combustion chamber is insulated using refractory cement, which will drop the temperature from about 700 Celsius inside the chamber to 200 Celsius outside the chamber. The cookstove outputs heat at a rate of 4.6-6.6 kW. The cookstove has thermoelectric modules attached to the outside, which, by utilizing the Seebeck effect, convert excess heat into electrical energy. Ideally, the energy would be transferred into the phone at 5 volts and 0.5-0.6 amps and some of the electrical energy would be used to power a cooling fan to help the stove function properly. The final temperatures that were recorded ranged from around 400ºC to 700ºC in the combustion chamber and around 500ºC for the cooking surface. Gasification was successfully occurring during this stage, and the smoke was being visibly burned off. The electrical output was less successful, resulting with only around 0.08 V coming out of the thermoelectric generators due to the lack of air flow within the electrical housing and poor electrical connection. The stove does achieve its primary functionality of being more than capable of boiling water, something that presently available cookstoves in Nicaragua cannot do consistently.",

The final selected foundation type is driven piles with the other options discarded due to lack of data and an unsuitability for the structure requirements. Piles are suitable for the deep, strong soils underlying the work site and the massive loads of the structure. Pile capacity and settlement of the final foundation design, as well as the strength of the designed retaining walls, safely met all project requirements. Additional recommendations were made in order to ensure accurate foundation construction.",

Travel to Nicaragua in March of 2018 determined that the entrepreneurship wanted a manual brick press to increase the mechanical properties of bricks while decreasing the time needed for the bricks to dry before being baked. Fabrication of a semi-functional beta prototype was completed in May of 2018. Prototype operational tests showed that one cycle of brick compression and retrieval took roughly 3.5 minutes to produce a single double-sized brick. Water absorptivity tests determined that compressed bricks of red art clay experienced a percent absorptivity of 20.5%, with non-compressed bricks formed in Nicaragua having an absorptivity of 35.0%. Finally, the ultimate compressive strength of bricks produced using the prototype averaged to 1,640 psi, as compared to 822 psi of the Nicaraguan brick. Insufficient data was collected to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the design. Several mechanical errors in clay compression and subsystem interferences merit further redesign. Recommendations for design iterations are included for future design teams to finalize and deploy the device.",

The objective of this project is to create a gastrointestinal (GI) phantom that emulates the electrical and material properties of the stomach, small intestine, and colon in order to test diagnostic GI biowearables. Our team also aimed to create a computer-simulated model of the phantom in order to predict and verify the phantom’s behaviors.\n We designed a phantom that is clinically representative of the abdominal GI system. It is made of an agarose- and salt-based hydrogel that mimics the tissue anterior to the GI organs, an electrical system that represents the signals that the GI organs produce, and a box that robustly combines the first two elements. We optimized our hydrogel and electrical system to produce clear output signals to be measured by biowearables during benchtop testing. We tested our complete phantom system to characterize its behavior, verify its effectiveness, and better inform biowearable testing. Further experimentation should be done before the phantom can completely characterize biowearable behavior. Continued development of the phantom should focus on enhancing its complexity to improve anatomical accuracy and increasing reliability.",

        "abstract": "Traditional plant characteristic improvement techniques are accompanied by certain disadvantages. Most notably, it takes several seasons in order to breed for favorable characteristics such as crop yield and disease resistance via deliberate selection. In order to expedite this improvement process, grafting - a method in which two separate plants with individual, desirable qualities are physically combined, may be used.\n This report explores the development of a regulated environment as a solution to many of the problems associated with the grafting of plants during their recovery stage. The grafting chamber model necessitates: (1) an ability to maintain the specific temperature, humidity and ambient light necessary to produce healthy grafts, (2) ease of use including setup and operation, (3) system portability and an extended lifetime.\n A review of scientific literature discussing the current state of typical grafting processes yields multiple requirements. The first of these requirements is a regulated environment that maintains a temperature between 72°F and 85 °F and a humidity between 85% and 95%. Also, the environment must be very dark and gradually increase to ambient conditions. The light, temperature, and humidity need to slowly taper to ambient conditions over the ten-day healing period in order to match the external environment. Due to the specificity of these conditions, grafting has historically been a labor-intensive process. Small-scale agricultural operations, those with less than 10,000 USD in annual sales, are impacted most severely by these constraints. The agricultural industry is often space-sensitive so collapsibility and portability are significant concerns.\n Here, the proof of concept of a grafting chamber capable of satisfying the market need defined by the above, is developed and presented. Stages of the product design process are evaluated individually within the scope of the project.",

Healthcare quality suffers because of this lack of reliable electricity. We propose that a gravity powered generator would stand as a reliable power source for small medical devices under any conditions at any location at any time of day. Our research examines how a gravity powered electric generator could best empower medical facilities in developing countries to provide improved healthcare. Our research has shown that most often, the greatest needs at these facilities are dependent upon an inadequate power supply, including lighting for emergency night-time care, refrigeration for blood and vaccines, facilities for sterilization, and electricity for simple medical devices [1]. We have chosen to focus on providing power for small devices as well as lighting. A successful charger must be lightweight, durable, and reliably provides dc power congruent with USB charging specifications. Testing has revealed a proof of concept, in that we were able to produce USB power from a mockup of the intended design, and further iterations of the charger will improve charge time per use. Initially, those seeking medical attention will be the main beneficiaries of our device; however, we expect the gravity generator project to expand if visitors see that our device could replace fossil or other solid fuel consuming device, such as kerosene lanterns, in their homes.",

Following greenhouse purchase and assembly, underground wiring for AC, DC and Ethernet lines were sized and installed. A substation was then designed and built in a designated shed, integrating wind turbines and photovoltaics rom past capstone projects. New charge controllers, batteries and circuit breakers were urchased and configured for the system. Worst-case electrical load and solar shading analyses also revealed that these older energy sources were collectively inadequate, so a secondary solar array was designed and flush-mounted to the shed roof; the system falls lightly short of desired year-round performance, but is otherwise a drastic improvement. Electrical measurements show that power is received at the greenhouse with a less than 3% voltage drop, meeting national Electric Code standards. To maintain the greenhouse environment, substation loads are specifically selected to allow for temperature control. These are driven by the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, which never leaves the greenhouse; an enclosed Raspberry Pi automates load operation through SainSmart relays and simple comparative logic. To account for both varying seasonal weather conditions and client accessibility, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is programmed to allow adjustment of all relevant control parameters via Wi-Fi in real-time. A battery monitor from a past capstone project is also reconfigured to run on Linux to estimate remaining stored energy. Project analyses include ethical, aesthetics, commercial benefit and basic photovoltaic rate-of-return analyses. Hypothetical scenarios are frequently presented to investigate the potential consequences of client and residentially-replicated usage of the entire system. It is also estimated that the combined photovoltaics will result in a lifetime net zero energy in 4.3 years of continuous expected use. Future project work involves tasks that could not be accomplished within the project time frame and budget. Among these include a larger solar array; the 24VDC integration of the horizontal wind turbine; rigorous seasonally-based testing of temperature controlling mechanisms for better parameter adjustments; and finally, the propagation of electrical power beyond the immediate premises and into the entire Walden West garden. Based on client needs, inspiration for future project work will likely draw from the tremendous success of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin non-profit organization, Growing Power.",

Our web application guides the users by providing them a list of questions and then produces the best fit cuisine for the whole group.",

        "abstract": "This project consists of the redesign of a three-story apartment complex for Habitat for Humanity that will be constructed in Walnut Creek, CA in 2017. A project in Fremont, CA served as the basis for the design. However, the height of the complex in Fremont exceeded the Walnut Creek Building Code height limitations, making the redesign of this timber structure necessary. The challenge was to reduce the structural space between stories to 9.5 inches in order to achieve comfortable interior clearances and meet the City of Walnut Creek’s height restriction. The structural components for Building Type A in the Las Juntas Way Apartment Complex were designed. Initially, a sawn lumber design was completed. However, this design did meet the target structural depth. Therefore, a design using TJI-joists was completed. This alternative met the target structural depth. From there, a lateral force resisting system with connection details and a mat foundation were designed. A cost analysis confirmed that the TJI-joist design was a cost-effective alternative. For sustainability, a Green Point Rating Checklist was completed. Lastly, a three-dimensional model was created using Revit, a four-dimensional Building Information Modeling technology. All structural drawings and calculations were submitted to Habitat for Humanity for use in the final design.",

To combat these issues, we propose a hands-free crutch that will attach only to the injured leg, increasing maneuverability while preserving natural walking mechanics. Within the last decade, other hands-free crutch solutionshave proven to increase user satisfaction by reducing fatigue, increasing safety and efficiency by allowing users to perform additional tasks with their hands, and allowing them to navigate more difficult obstacles. Our product aims to be more customizable, comfortable, and affordable than such hands-free solutions. This crutch is designed to give the user the opportunity to suspend their injured leg at a variety of angles to alleviate varying amounts of stress. In addition, a “stair mode” uses a hydraulic suspension to shorten the crutch and allow the user to more easily raise their leg up to the next step.",

        "abstract": "Developing and proving the effectiveness of ECG-based TRNGs for use in cryptography applications related to implantable medical devices (IMDs) offers a novel approach to securing IMDs. Current ECG-based True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) are software orientated and computationally heavy with hardware implementations being suggested as one possible solution to make such TRNGs useful for the medical device industry. Hardware offers the opportunity to increase power efficiency through algorithmic optimization while maintaining device security. In this paper, we use Verilog design and FPGA simulation tools to demonstrate the potential for hardware-accelerated ECG-based TRNGs for use in low power cryptographic applications. This is achieved by building an ECG-based TRNG with five functional blocks: noise extraction, storage of unique data, memory control, Lift and Shift, and data output. The Lift and Shift portion of the algorithm is the foundation of our TRNG and is critical to the operation and effectiveness of our solution through the use of a hash function, matrix mixer, and barrel shifters. Our experiments show that hardware implementations of ECG-based TRNGs are possible and practical with higher bit rate outputs than similar python-based solutions and the potential for desirable power efficiency. Further verification of our TRNGs randomness is to be completed with industry-accepted and national governing body-approved statistical test suites. We believe that an FPGA design allows for computational efficiency for ECG-based TRNGs when compared to software approaches while maintaining cryptographic security. This will be critical to ensuring IMD device security while maintaining the necessary ten-plus-year lifespan of such devices.",

To protect these areas new shoreline protection was proposed. To begin designing new shore protection, the existing levee was analyzed on GeoSlope after doing numerous soil testing.

After evaluating three alternatives, designing a horizontal levee was found to be the most efficient solution because it is sustainable, able to preserve most of the project area's natural features, and is within reasonable costs. The new horizontal levee is sufficient enough to protect against all possible failure modes after a thirty-six inch sea level rise.",

In this report, we focused on developing a sustainable and low impact street design by following standard traffic codes to redesign Hearst Avenue to accommodate all modes of transportation. The team worked on the section of Hearst Avenue from Oxford Street to La Loma Avenue\"”which is approximately 2640 feet (0.5 mile) and consists of 8 intersections\"”and developed two designs addressing different street features. These two designs were combined for the final design to incorporate automobile lanes, bicycle lanes, parking spots, and increased sidewalk additions that would not cause excessive traffic congestion or stormwater flooding. The level of street service was well within the desired result, whereas the street layout of vehicle and bicycle lanes demanded more attention. While the design team expected different results, the stormwater analysis portion of the design proved to indicate additional green drainage features would not be a necessity. Though the SCU design team for this portion of the Hearst Avenue Complete Street design project is complete, there are a few recommendations we would make for future teams to consider. Among these design alternatives is a more detailed traffic analysis utilizing daily traffic counts for Hearst Avenue, and implementing a permeable pavement design to address stormwater street drainage. In conclusion, the SCU design team was able to optimize design features along Hearst Avenue within the constraints of the site.",

This gap in the market is one that the Heavy Lift Drone (HLD) fills - a light-weight, higher payload capability, and inexpensive drone to be used in commercial applications - most notably irrigation monitoring. The HLD is a contra-rotating hexagonal configuration system featuring two levels of propellers that allow for larger propeller diameter and generate greater lift. After performing extensive finite element analyses and material testing, as well as the design, assembly, and flight test of a quadcopter prototype, the equipment, electronics, and components to be used on the final HLD were chosen. The four individual subsystems - mechanical, aerospace, electronics, and software - were each addressed and analyzed separately. It was found that the inclusion of the ducts (shrouds) around the propellers does indeed increase the lift of the drone by a factor of 14.7%. Additionally, the final projected cost for the drone, including labor and volume production, was significantly lower than that of our direct competitors, standing at $13,921. This is nearly 8.5% lower than the nearest comparable drone available for sale, while also featuring a higher projected payload to weight ratio of 0.5, as opposed to 0.4 for the competition. Finally, the HLD utilized multiple software applications that were implemented for effective flight planning, automated image stitching, and analysis of the IR photos taken during flight operation in order to generate a new flight plan.",

        "abstract": "A culture of social taboos and silence leaves many young women beginning menarche in isolation, without complete understanding of the changes occurring in their bodies. There is a widespread stigma surrounding menstruation all around the world. These stigma impose significant barriers to education and proper hygiene for young girls during a critical time in their lives. Not having the proper support and resources to manage this process, 1 in 10 girls in sub-Saharan Africa miss school during their period, and therefore are more likely to drop out altogether. In Kenya specifically, menstruating girls miss an average of 4.9 days of school each month, contributing to 37% of Kenyan girls completing secondary school compared to 46% of boys. This problem is compounded by financial barriers to accessing sanitary pads, especially for low-income Kenyan women, since only 35% of Kenyan women can afford sanitary pads independently. Recognizing this disparity, in June 2017, the Kenyan government pledged to provide free sanitary pads to all Kenyan schoolgirls.\n Our team has utilized this opportunity to develop a culturally appropriate, Android-based menstruation education mobile application using Googles Android Studio- Hedhi Help. Aiming to empower Kenyan girls with the knowledge, support, and resources needed to take charge of their menstrual cycles and understand their bodies, the application has been developed with two end-users in mind: girls who have begun menstruating, and those who have not yet begun. The application features four components: (i) a period tracking calendar, (ii) a Facebook discussion forum, (iii) a resource connection page, and (iv) a menstruation education component.\n The period tracker calendar utilizes the Google Calendar API to enable users to track the dates of their periods and predict future periods based on past entries. The Facebook discussion forum will be a dedicated Facebook page where girls can connect and communicate with others. The resource connection page uses the Google Maps API to find health clinics near the users current location to increase access to healthcare resources. The menstruation education component is comprised of three modules that utilize a storybook approach focusing on how the body changes prior to menarche, the purpose and process of menstruation, debunking myths and stigmas, and explaining proper menstruation self-care. The app does not require any internet connection after the initial download because users can create a personalized profile to use the educational modules and calendar functions without network connectivity. The core logic and all visual elements were coded using the Java and XML languages, respectively. Information regarding the users profiles is stored and managed with Google Firebase, and version control is managed with Github. This mobile app provides a frugal platform for delivery of menstruation education and access to healthcare resources to a large audience, empowering young women with the tools and knowledge to properly manage their menstruation and stay in school. This is an e ample of how mobile technology can be impactful when the appropriate app is developed for a specific population.",

EV surface engineering is a critical step to achieve targeted drug delivery. By engineering EVs with transmembrane scaffolds, targeting molecules can be displayed on the EV outer surface, and cargos can be loaded into the EV lumen. However, EV heterogeneity and inadequate EV purification and characterization methods impose great challenges on understanding engineered EVs and choosing appropriate transmembrane scaffolds. To this day, surface engineered EVs are still limited to lab research. In this thesis, we modify the EV surface with four transmembrane scaffolds, including native tetraspanins (CD9, CD63 and CD81) and viral envelope glycoprotein (VSVG). We then use a high-throughput and on-chip method to analyze the size and surface marker profile of engineered EVs at single-particle level and measure the engineering efficacy. Our results show that the four transmembrane scaffolds exhibit distinct differences in engineering efficacy and subpopulation integration as well as their impact on EV size and surface marker profile. Consequently, our results provide insights in EV surface engineering by revealing the unique capabilities and characteristics of each transmembrane scaffold. This study may empower the translation of engineered EV from lab research into real clinical applications.",

Our solution is primarily used as a mobile application, but also runs on Amazon Alexa for easy access at all times. Additionally, our smart backend automatically suggests housemates to complete tasks based on previous history.

However, mammalian cell storage and handling remains a costly and involved process. Organisms that survive extreme conditions are known to utilize the disaccharide trehalose. We have tested the effects of trehalose exposure on desiccation and cryopreservation on 3D encapsulated human embryonic kidney cell viability. Exposed cells showed survival up to 3 days at desiccating conditions and survival and growth after exposure to cryogenic temperatures. This study shows that trehalose exposed mammalian cells in a 3D scaffold can be utilized to retain viability at extreme conditions.",

The solutions to these problems rely on concrete, and are currently limited by the mixing time for these batches of concrete in rural and remote areas. Mixing with shovels is inefficient and imprecise, and the possible solution of a portable gas-powered concrete mixer is too expensive and too immobile for remote areas. The Human-Powered Concrete Mixer (HPCM) provides an alternative to these methods that is more efficient and more precise than hand mixing with shovels, yet cheaper and more mobile than a portable gas-powered concrete mixer. Our team was able to successfully design a mixer that, in comparison to mixing with shovels, reduced mixing time from 15 minutes to 5 minutes, reduced the necessary number of laborers from 6 to 2, and produced structurally sound concrete. The modular design of the mixer allows the HPCM to be easily moved to remote construction areas, and the cost of the mixer makes it more economically viable for non-profit organizations and social enterprises than a gas-powered alternative. In sum, the HPCM provides a low cost, efficient, mobile, and reproducible alternative that enables non-profit organizations and social enterprises to more effectively help more people.",

        "abstract": "The objective of our project was to sensitize drug-resistant cancer cells to conventional forms of chemotherapy, in particular taxane drugs which stabilize tubulin, thereby arresting dividing cells in mitosis, thus activating the apoptotic pathway in these cells and driving them to their death. One mechanism that allows cells to acquire resistance is the overexpression of a certain class of proteins called inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). Upregulation of these molecules permits the cells to evade death, despite their having incurred damaged from exposure to toxic levels of taxane. We employed a cloaking agent (a molecular formulation provided to us by our pharma-collaborator Novartis) that was developed to block the action of these IAPs by binding them and prompting them to disengage the cells' repressed caspase “executioner” proteases. This in turn causes apoptosis to resume, with the downstream effect being an overall sensitization to taxane. To substantiate this hypothesis, we performed a number of proof-of-concept experiments that included several rounds of cell viability assays. In the first step, we treated a parental strain and a drug-resistant variant with taxane alone to determine the IC50 values of the two cell lines and to characterize the difference in their resistance levels. In the second step, we subjected both cell lines to the cloaking agent by itself to confirm that it is not detrimental to the cells in the absence of taxane. In the third step, we quantified cell survival rates upon combination treatment with taxane and inhibitor together and found that there was an increase in cell death with increasing concentrations of inhibitor (i.e. we successfully lowered the IC50 values). The implication of our findings is the possibility of a novel treatment regimen that clinicians can use to try and kill robust cancer cells that have acquired resistance after repeated rounds of chemotherapy. The treatment could only be implemented in human patients following in vivo studies and clinical trials.",

The identification of said drug target(s) (Molecule X) will allow for the development of an antibody based drug that will neutralize bacterial virulence rather than killing the bacteria. Molecule X will be bound using the protein Sortase A (SrtA). SrtA is a surface protein that controls the virulence of gram positive bacteria by anchoring virulence factors to the cell surface. Molecule X is the signal from mammalian cells that initiates this process. Blocking this signal prevents the activation of bacterial virulence.\n SrtA is obtained from E. coli cells using affinity chromatography and Molecule X is obtained by collecting the entire mammalian proteome of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The SrtA and mammalian proteome are mixed together with a crosslinker to covalently bind Molecule X to SrtA. The cross-linked products are purified and analyzed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) and the proteins are identified using a proteomic database. The resulting data is analyzed for Molecule X candidates by grouping the proteins into clusters based on function and subcellular location. The identified clusters are calcium ion dependent, membrane associated, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) associated, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding proteins.",

We worked closely with one of the employees at iKure, meeting biweekly through conference calls, in order to keep up to date on the companys developments. After careful consideration and additional feedback from iKure, we came up with a two-part system.

Therefore, in response to this global health threat, our project focuses on furthering the research in developing a drug that S. aureus will not develop resistance to. In this paper, we assess NPY-Y2 as a potential immuno-anti-infective drug target to prevent the activation of Sortase A on S. aureus.

In today's world, smartphones are being used on the go more often, creating an increased demand for battery life. The capacity of current batteries cannot keep up with the constant usage of data in such activities as emailing, social media, apps, and more. We developed an efficient, ergonomic, and aesthetically pleasing phone case that can manually charge a smartphone without an electrical outlet, but by means of electromagnetic induction. This product would target two main demographics: business people who are constantly on the go, and the outdoors enthusiasts who are not always near an electrical outlet. The product will give users peace of mind knowing that their phone will not die without an outlet or a plug-in phone charger. The phone case would feature a magnet and coil system as an electrical power generator. The magnet and coil will convert energy from mechanical input created by the user spinning a wheel mounted to the rear face of the case. The rotational input of the user is transferred to the generator via a gear train with a final drive ratio of 1:48. With an average input of 4 newtons of force, 2 revolutions per second, and a radius of 2 centimeters of the disc, the mechanical energy provided will create the needed voltage and current for approximately 1 Watt of electrical power. A smartphone draws around 0.4 to 0.5 Watts of power in an idle state, meaning that this 1 Watt will provide the power to overcome idle power draw. We made a simple and intuitive case that features lightweight, ergonomic, and efficient attributes. Physical testing has been conducted on selected generators, yielding promising results. Housing prototypes were 3D printed for fitment testing, while drop tests were conducted theoretically through FEA modelling and testing.",

To meet this objective we created a Pressure Sensitive Adhesive (PSA) to seal and waterproof the pumps. To reduce human error and increase consistency of application we created a press. We did validation testing to confirm that our PSA had the capability to seal the housing. We were able to prove that our PSA was a viable method to replace liquid adhesive. The PSA demonstrated the capability to meet all the requirements that Asante had given for the project. The design of the PSA that we propose is the optimal for the current design of the housings. With this in mind our solution still needs small alterations to the housing to allow for the PSA to completely seal the pumps to Asante Solutions standards.",

Developing countries like these need a form of economical construction. Our design and manufacturing process for interlocking CMU (concrete masonry unit) blocks can help build low-cost homes quickly and efficiently. Wall construction costs are reduced because skilled masons are not needed to build the wall. Instead, unskilled homeowners and laborers can stack the interlocking blocks, which serve as forms for the subsequent placement of reinforcement and grout within some of the CMU block voids. Using a steel mold, we were able to produce 4 sample blocks. With various design constraints in mind, we narrowed our block down to one design. We then designed a mold to make the blocks. Even though our mold design was sufficient for making the blocks, recommendations such as funneled walls on the top rim of the mold form could be used for improved block construction. Since we were not able to reach our intended goal of building a wall from our interlocking block design due to time constraints, we left that portion of our project as future work.",

        "abstract": "Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) also known as Pseudotumor Cerebri is a condition resulting from an increase of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), a fluid that helps to protect the brain and spinal cord, in the cranial cavity. Currently the only treatment method for this health condition is the draining of the fluid via implanted intracranial shunts that get clogged in approximately 50% of patients. Clogged shunts can only be detected when IIH symptoms begin to reappear. We propose to create an ultrasound-read intracranial pressure sensor used to supplement shunts implanted in patients who suffer from Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension. This will provide immediate knowledge of clogged catheters, preventing further damage to accrue due to an unknown buildup of pressure, prior to, and when symptoms begin to show. This pressure sensor will significantly benefit the current treatment method by allowing easy and immediate diagnosis of the current condition of the CSF and the shunt. This completely mitigates harmful symptoms that occur while Idiopathic Intracranial hypertension is left untreated and provides a simple method of keeping track of the patient’s current state, enabling doctors to know immediately when an additional shunt is necessary. In this paper, we design and fabricate an intracranial pressure sensor that is intended to be read via ultrasound. Our experiments show that our design is capable of reading pressure changes in water. Using a light microscope, we were also able to correlate the movement of the air-liquid interface in the sensor channel to pressure changes. From these findings, we hope that the sensitivity of the sensor can be further refined and will be tested for visibility under ultrasound.",

In this paper, we developed and tested a predictive system using sensors and general weather trends in the day to control blind controllers. This system attempts to maintain a target temperature so that the need for heating and cooling will be reduced, thereby decreasing the power used by AC and heating units. As a result of our experiments, we can conclude that it is beneficial to have the motorized blinds system while direct sunlight is interacting with that specific window. However, more research is needed to understand the extent of these benefits as well as if there is any benefit to the system when the window is not in direct sunlight. Consequently, to better understand the true abilities of a motorized blind system we need a more adequate, robust testing environment that accounts for the variations in the temperature throughout the year. Through more testing, we can understand to what extent the predictionary motorized blinds system limits temperature variation and how room position in relation to the sun's path can affect the effectiveness of the blinds system. Lastly, we can use this information to understand the economics of the system and the potential cost benefits to users of the system.",

With all IoT products in one ecommerce site, users only have to visit one site in order to search for or browse IoT products. Thus, user’s will be able to browse/search for products from a variety of different manufacturers and will be able to purchase those products right on the website. After, transactions and payment processes, the seller (IoT Company will be notified) and then from their warehouse, the IoT product(s) will be shipped directly to the consumer. Additionally, these IoT products can range from components to specific devices, thus accommodating not only other businesses that use these IoT components, but also specific users (consumers).",

This 99.99% recovery rate demonstrates that, when treated with antibiotics, TB is an extremely curable condition, but an early diagnosis is critical to surviving the illness. Developing countries face the largest hurdles to accessing TB screening technologies, and they make up a disproportionately high fraction of worldwide TB deaths. A possible solution to this problem would be to use machine learning (ML) to detect TB on cough sounds. However, there currently is not enough data to develop such an application. In this paper, we discuss our android tablet application (Ekifuba Test) that begins the process of collecting cough and demographics data across Uganda. This data will be used to accrue training data for a future TB diagnosing ML application. By eliminating the need to carry around medical equipment, replaced with a single android tablet, this ML model would serve as a vastly more accessible alternative to our contemporary TB diagnostic approaches. Currently in the testing stage, we have delivered our data collection application to Ugandan clinicians, who will shortly begin using our technology in the field to accrue real-world samples. Once we have collected sufficient data, two of our team members will work to develop the aforementioned ML model by training it on the acquired samples–in an effort to finally create an affordable, accessible solution to the TB diagnosing problem.",

We pull music from existing services so users can continue to listen to all of the music they are accustomed to, but we also provide users with better ways to discover new music. In addition to providing a platform for real time location based playlist collaboration, the application recommends songs based on what people in a user’s immediate location are listening too.

By using the tags associated with each location and with each user, our algorithm is able to generate a recommendation list tailored to the interests of each user. We made an intuitive user interface by creating a simple, clean layout for each screen the user see. We wanted the users to be able to glance at the screen and immediately know what is possible to do while at that screen and what is the purpose of said screen. We have clearly labeled buttons for each of the possible actions, and use color coordination to draw the users attention to important information. By the end of the project we had an application with an intuitive user interface and an algorithm that could achieve our goal.

The bioink consisted of chitosan and proteins. Chitosan is a thermosetting hydrogel that can print as a liquid at room temperature and gel when raised to a temperature of 40oC. We performed characterization testing to find the optimal motor speed and flow rate to create a continuous flow of the bioink.

        "abstract": "Nitrate contamination is one of the most ubiquitous water contaminants worldwide. Consuming small amounts of nitrate has been linked to Blue Baby Syndrome, various cancers, and other reproductive health effects1. To combat this problem, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set nitrate limits in drinking water to 50 ppm. Frequent widespread testing of water sources in high-risk regions is critical to protecting public health. However, current nitrate detection methods are inherently inaccurate or too expensive for frequent use where they are needed most. To satisfy this unmet need, we present a novel point-of-use microfluidic sensor for the electrochemical detection of nitrate in drinking water for use in developing countries where this problem is prevalent. Our device is robust, inexpensive, and accurate, rendering it ideal for use in developing countries. Our proposed device utilizes a three-electrode system to detect nitrate electrochemically via inexpensive disposable chips. The working electrode is copper-plated copper ink, the counter electrode silver ink, and the reference electrode silver/silver chloride ink. The electrodes are painted onto a vinyl substrate, providing a cost-effective platform. The electrodes are housed in an acrylic casing. When the sensor is connected to an electrochemical analyzer and a small volume of water sample is deposited onto the sensor. Differential pulse voltammetry is performed with a potential range of 0 to – 0.8 V at a rate of 0.1 V/sec, producing a current peak for our analyte. Our electrochemical sensor detects nitrate in water with high sensitivity as low as 14 ppm, well below the maximum limit of the WHO requirement. The microfluidic sensor combined with a hand-held electrochemical analyzer represents one example of a growing trend towards point-of-care diagnostics. This proposed platform, combined with a mobile application as demonstrated by us and others2, is capable of delivering accurate and rapid readings at the water sources will contribute to identify the contaminated sources and to evaluate the efficiency of water treatment, as well as to inform public health regulatory agencies with this pertinent information.",

        "abstract": "A brain aneurysm is a thin or weak spot on a blood vessel wall that expands and fills with blood. Brain aneurysms are very dangerous due to the fact that in most cases, patients do not show any symptoms. Because of this, aneurysms are difficult to diagnose unless it becomes very large or ruptures, resulting in fatal hemorrhage.\n Aneurysms can be detected by a number of different brain imaging methods including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA), Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) and other imaging methods but for the sake of this report we will only be focusing on MRA. MRA scans are optimal for the detection of brain aneurysms because they produce images that can be used to distinguish blood vessels from surrounding stationary tissue. Since aneurysms happen only in the blood vessels, MRA scans are an ideal image type to train a predictive machine learning model for our purposes.\n Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are all growing fields that are leading to breakthroughs in the medical community. For machine learning models and algorithms specifically, they have greatly helped in analyzing, locating, and predicting critical health conditions including brain aneurysms.\n With the help of this technology, medical professionals, such as radiologists, can greatly benefit from the predictions these models can provide. Image interpretation by human experts can be limited due to subjectivity, complexity of the image, extensive variations across different interpreters, and fatigue. With the help of these models, physicians and radiologists will be able to make more accurate and precise diagnoses with predictive algorithms serving as a second opinion. More specifically, with the help of machine learning and MR Angiography, a predictive model can be trained to help detect brain aneurysms that might otherwise go unnoticed by radiologists. Here, we have developed four convolutional neural network (CNN) models that successfully detect aneurysm presence within MRA scans. Further investigation should be done to validate and improve these models to create a more accurate and sensitive diagnostic platform.",

        "abstract": "The use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in consumer and commercial products is increasing rapidly. The small size and high surface reactivity of ENMs gives them a range of attractive properties, and allows them to be incorporated into various materials. These properties make ENMs very appealing to modern industry, but also make ENMs toxic, causing serious health and environmental concerns. This toxicity is largely driven by the formation of a protein corona on the surface of ENMs. This protein corona is caused by proteins encountered in biological systems that bind to the surface of (ENMs). Despite the importance of the protein corona, little research has been done to control protein corona formation and model the biological conditions that contribute to protein-ENM binding. We present a quantitative characterization of proteins found bound on the surface of silver ENMs. A matrix of protein- ENM reactions were evaluated, including varied ENM sizes and surface coatings, as well as solution conditions (e.g. salt concentrations). Machine learning (random forest) classification was applied to this protein-ENM data matrix to evaluate the competing roles of the biophysical properties of proteins, ENM properties, and solution conditions in mediating formation of the ENM protein corona. The resulting model offers an accurate prediction of protein enrichment on ENMs with a receiver operating characteristic-score accuracy of 0.83. The effects of each variable in the formation of the ENM protein corona is calculated to provide recommendations for mechanistic models based upon protein quantification. Our model offers the framework to engineer ENMs to minimize the binding of toxic proteins, or maximize the binding of non-toxic proteins on the surface of ENMs.",

        "advisor": "Ying Liu",
        "abstract": "In the treatment of cancer using ionizing radiation, it is important to design a treatment plan such that dose to normal, healthy organs is sufficiently low. Today, segmentation requires a trained human to carefully outline, or segment, organs on each slice of a treatment planning computed tomography (CT) scan but it is laborious, time-consuming, and contains intra- and inter-rater variability. Currently, existing clinical automation technology relies on atlas-based automation, which has limited segmentation accuracy. Thus the auto-segmentations require post process editing by an expert. In this paper, we propose a machine learning solution that shortens the segmentation time of organs-at-risk (OARs) in the thoracic cavity. The overall system will include preprocessing, model processing, and postprocessing steps to make the system easily integratable into the radiotherapy planning process. For our model, we chose to use a 3D deep convolutional neural network with a U-net based architecture because this machine learning strategy takes into account local spatial relationships, will restore the original image resolution and has been utilized in image segmentation, especially in medical image analysis. Training and testing were done with a 60 patient dataset of thoracic CT scans from the AAPM 2017 Grand Challenge. To assess and improve our system we calculated accuracy metrics (Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean surface distance (MSD)) and compared our model’s segmentation performance to that of an expert and the top two performing machine learning methods of the challenge. We explored using preprocessing steps such as cropping and image enhancement to improve the model segmentation accuracy. Our final model was able to segment the lungs as accurately as a dosimetrist and the heart and spinal cord within acceptable DSC ranges. All DSC values of the OARs from our method were as accurate as other machine learning methods. The DSC for the esophagus was below tolerable error for radiotherapy planning, but our mean surface distance was superior to other auto-segmentation methods. We were successful in significantly reducing manual segmentation time by developing a machine learning system. Though our approach still necessitates a single preparatory step of manually cropping anatomical regions to isolate segmentation volume, a general hospital technician could complete this task which removes the need of an expert for one time-consuming step of radiotherapy planning. Implementation of our methods to provide radiotherapy in lower-middle income countries brings us closer to accessibility of treatment for a wider population.",

This seismic test series addressed the effect of mesh wire type on ductility and the validity of the existing wall slenderness limits. The tests focused on slender walls dominated by flexural deformations. Welded wire mesh wall performed better than the woven wire mesh wall of the same detailing, yet fell short of expected values. Slenderness must continue to be analyzed as the results of a wall using 14” bales were impacted by bale irregularity. The additional tests done as part of this thesis, including vertical load tests and materials testing, added to the understanding of strawbale construction performance and expanded the corpus of strawbale wall test data. All tested walls performed satisfactorily under vertical loading in post-seismic conditions. The purpose of this test series was to validate and potentially suggest improvements to the building code provisions to enhance the prevalence and safety of strawbale construction.",

        "abstract": "In South Africa and around the world, the rates of severe burns are a significant health issue. Skin grafts are used to improve the function and appearance of the burned area and reduce the amount of time a patient is in the hospital. To minimize the amount of skin needed and maximize the coverage of the graft, the harvested sample is meshed in a lattice pattern so it can expand and graft a much larger surface area. Unfortunately, the current methods and devices used in both high and low-income countries have been optimized for hospitals with larger budgets and more readily available resources.\n In this project, we developed a frugal skin graft expansion device for low resource settings in developing countries. After identifying the needs of low-resource countries, we prototyped possible solutions and tested them, achieving both the meshing pattern and graft expansion. We then created further iterations of our design to more fully meet the needs of developing countries.\n We believe our frugal device will fill a need in the current field of burn care devices in developing countries and significantly increase the number of burn patients successfully treated in low resource settings, allowing them to reintegrate into society and live healthy and productive lives.",

Robotic surgery is replacing traditional open surgery at a rapid pace due to the obvious health benefits, however, most of the robotic surgical tools use robotic motion controllers that are designed to work over a large portion of the human body, thus involving motion of the entire human arm at shoulder joint. This requirement to move a large inertial mass results in undesirable, unwanted, and imprecise motion. This senior design project has created a 2-axis micro-motion “capable” platform, where the device studies the most common linear, 2-D surgical micro-motion of pinched human fingers in a damped and un-damped state. Through a system of printed and modeled parts in combination with motors and encoders a microsurgical controller was developed which can provide location-based output on a screen. Mechanical damping was introduced to research potential stability of micro-motion in any surgeon’s otherwise unsteady hand. The device is to also serve as a starter set for future biomedical device research projects in Santa Clara University’s bioengineering department. Further developments in the microsurgical controller such as further scaling, addition of a third axis, haptic feedback through the microcontroller, and component encasing to allow productization for use on an industrial robotic surgical device for clinical applications.",

Our goal is to use this device to measure the concentration of continuous bioamine microdialysis samples directly from the pericardial cavity (the area surrounding the heart) of Cancer borealis. The microfluidic device that we designed is made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and exhibits an off-channel configuration of capillary electrophoresis (CE) by incorporating micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). CE is used to separate bioamines based on charge and size due to the applied electrical potential. In the off-channel configuration, the potential is applied across the separation channel and grounded by the palladium decoupler, which lies just before the detector. Microchip CE is advantageous because it uses small amounts of analyte and completes fast run times. We will use MEKC to separate dopamine and octopamine, since they are structural isomers, by their difference in affinity to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles. This results in different elution times for dopamine and octopamine. We were able to drive the fluid in the correct direction. The creation of this device has valuable implications, allowing for baseline concentrations of neuromodulators with the Cancer borealis to be established.

Our team addressed that issue by creating a simple, microfluidic cell patterning system.

We intend this device to meet the World Health Organization's (WHO's) ASSURED criteria for diagnostic devices in developing regions. Our electrochemical solution utilizes a three-electrode system with carbon, silver, and silver/silver chloride ink electrodes printed onto a disposable plastic substrate. A small water sample is applied to the electrodes and the current response is quickly captured, returning quantitative information to the user. This alleviates the lag times and imprecise colorimetric assays that encumber current arsenic detection systems.

As a proof-of-concept, our device uses a microfluidic chip, smartphone, and microlens to detect E. coli concentrations in water. The detection method is based on the latex agglutination assay which relies on visual observations and judgment to determine the presence of pathogens in the water sample. Our approach provides a quantification of the traditional latex agglutination output, and the lower detection limit (105cells/mL) is competitive with that of the traditional agglutination method. In developing such a platform, a cheap and effective detection test for people in developing countries can be available worldwide for easy determination of whether or not a fluid sample is safe for use, and with several modifications, this platform could potentially be used to detect different pathogens, simultaneously.",

To meet this rising demand in both a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner, we proposed and simulated a complete energy management system with cost analysis of energy savings of a microgrid capable of reducing the power supplied to Santa Clara University’s campus from the grid by 40% using renewable energy, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) functionality, and real SCU energy data. The project further used machine learning to match SCU’s energy demand with the renewable generation for future use of optimizing the proposed system. The microgrid was simulated in MATLAB while the machine learning algorithm was developed in python. The benefits of this project provide SCU with a path to 100% clean energy, increased power reliability, and reduced operating cost for SCU. Increasing solar output on campus is the best way to achieve 100% renewable energy because the fuel cells on campus have a byproduct of carbon dioxide and are therefore not 100% renewable. Our vehicle to grid analysis showed that it is not currently a viable solution to help SCU run on 100% renewable energy; however, as electric vehicle charging capacity at SCU increases, vehicle to grid could become an important part of SCU achieving carbon neutrality.",

However , many women around the world lack the ability to breastfeed their children due to disease, malnutrition, time constraints, or cultural considerations. Human breast milk banks exist to collect and distribute breast milk , allowing the greatest number of infants to have access to safe breast milk for optimal nutrition. To ensure the safety of the breast milk that is donated and distributed, milk banks must pasteurize and test donated breast milk for biological hazards such as bacteria. While pasteurization methods in the United States and other highly developed nations are reliable, they are often costly and resource intensive. In developing nations , high-throughput , consistent pasteurization methods are rarely available, resulting in a higher risk of donated breast milk samples containing harmful bacteria, such as Escherichia coli.\n MilkGuard is a hydrogel-based biosensor intended to detect Escherichia coli (E. coli) in samples of donated breast milk. The sensor functions to indicate the concentration of E. coli bacteria present in a sample of donated breast milk through a colorimetric change. In order to produce a functional biosensor, this project included iterative reproducibility and accuracy tests to confirm MilkGuard's capability of consistently detecting and indicating the presence of small concentrations of E. coli bacteria. By improving the induction and lysing processes of E. coli, this project optimized the protocol through which MilkGuard's effectiveness can be evaluated. Through the use of COMSOL Multiphysics software, this project modelled the physics of MilkGuard's reaction to optimize the thickness of the sensor. Our goal is to improve the reproducibility and accuracy of MilkGuard to create a more robust sensor that can save lives by determining the safety of donated human breast milk before distribution to vulnerable infants.",

In an attempt to address the medical issues this causes, human breast milk banks have been established in some of these communities and healthy mothers have been encouraged to donate their breast milk for infants who would not otherwise have access to breast milk. Since many of these banks are located in resource limited areas, they often lack proper refrigeration and pasteurization equipment. Improper refrigeration and incomplete pasteurization of donated breast milk often results in the donated breast milk being infected with Escherichia coli (E. coli). Recently, non- governmental organizations such as PATH, a leader in global health innovation, have stepped in to develop simple methods for flash heat pasteurization that can be used in resource limited areas without current equipment. However, there is no existing way to ensure that breast milk has been pasteurized properly by flash heat pasteurization. Thus, there is an immediate need for a sensor that can detect pathogenic E. coli bacteria in the breast milk after this pasteurization. The objective of our project is to design an economical paper-based microfluidic sensor that tests for levels of E. coli in donated breast milk. The goal is to ensure that all distributed breast milk pasteurized by the flash heat pasteurization process is safe for infants to consume before it is distributed.",

Because of this, a network of more than 500+ human milk banks, which collect and distribute donated breast milk to infants, have emerged worldwide. However, operational costs to ensure the safety of this milk remain time-intensive and costly.\n There are no existing diagnostics for rapid and on-site detection of bacterial contaminants in donated milk. Currently, many milk banks send samples to outside laboratories for bacterial culturing tests, which take 24-48 hours to receive results. In contrast, MilkGuard is an on-site detection method which ensures results in hours rather than days. To determine whether or not E.coli is present in donated milk, a drop of milk is deposited onto the sensor. If the milk is contaminated, the sensor will turn a blue color due to an enzyme-substrate reaction of the bacteria.\n The goal of the project is to create a cost and rapid alternative to traditional bacterial culturing testing to screen for E. coli bacteria in donated human breast milk.

Human breast milk banks do exist to try to alleviate this problem, but most are underfunded and have high operational costs, making it difficult for some infants to obtain safe, reliable donated breast milk.\n Existing methods of testing breast milk are expensive, so the MilkGuard project was conceptualized in 2017 as a fast, economical, and highly usable bacterial contamination detection system. Prior to this year, previous MilkGuard teams had developed a system that was faster and more affordable than prior methods, but its main drawbacks were that it was difficult to use and that it lacked the sensitivity to detect low Escherichia coli (E. coli) contamination levels. To ameliorate these drawbacks, our goals for this year were 1) to improve MilkGuard’s sensitivity to the Human Milk Banking Association of North America’s (HMBANA) lower limit of detection standard of 104 CFU/mL, 2) to increase the ease of the assay process, and 3) to achieve these objectives in an economical and environmentally-friendly way.\n Through COMSOL Multiphysics software simulations, we proved the possibility of realistically optimizing biosensor parameters on a computer. Since the simulations were virtual, we discovered an optimal biosensor configuration without the need to purchase, manufacture, and test hundreds of physical sensors. Future teams can quickly confirm these results by building a physical sensor in the lab. We also developed the MilkGuard app, which greatly simplifies the colorimetric analysis process for the user. This mobile app uses our improved color-analysis algorithm which improves detection sensitivity around the HMBANA’s lowered limit of detection standard, given the same image data to analyze. The efficacy of our new color analysis algorithm can be confirmed by future teams in the lab, and our current regression curve can be made more robust with a larger sample size.\n Taken together, our developments this year have increased the usability and sensitivity of the MilkGuard system, which can improve bacterial contamination testing by milk banks and move one step closer to equitable access to safe breast milk for infants around the world.",

Continuous glucose monitors are able to stay implanted on the patient anywhere from 7-14 days, giving patients and doctors valuable information to help improve patient care for diabetics, and providing them with a way to continuously monitor their blood glucose level concentration throughout the day.\n Conventional methods of glucose detection such as blood glucose meters require the patient to gather frequent blood samples to generate instantaneous results that are only accurate as of the time of day the reading was taken. These methods fail to take account of daily fluctuations in glucose levels that can arise from changes in diet and physical activity.\n In an effort to optimize cost, reliability, and accessibility, this paper proposes a minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring system that is able to detect glucose levels in interstitial fluid through the use of solid 3D printed microneedles. This CGM device would provide an easily affordable, accessible, and pain-free option for diabetic patients. Providing patients with a way to continuously monitor their glucose levels allows for more personal involvement with their health decisions and ultimately serves as a guide toward more effective diabetes management.",

        "advisor": "Prashanth Asuri",
        "abstract": "In recent years, much attention has been given to the effects of radiation on bone deterioration. Past research has demonstrated that radiation acts to alter the balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, promoting a net osteoclastic activity in the affected bone tissue, but specific molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Gene expression of many osteoclast markers is upregulated early in response to radiation, leading to bone resorption. This problem is especially prominent in space, as astronauts are regularly exposed to full body ionizing radiation that, over extended periods of time, may lead to significant bone loss. Research suggests that radiation leads to an inflammatory response in bone tissue, which leads to oxidative stress damage and increased osteoclast activity. Numerous natural compounds have been studied in vitro and have been observed to reduce the gene expression of bone resorption genes and their protein derivatives. We have attempted to take a closer look at the mechanisms by which radiation impairs bone health by examining the microarchitecture of mouse bones and the gene expression of osteoclast, osteoblast, and osteocyte markers. Much research has been devoted to studying osteoclastic activity because this is believed to play the most influential role in bone loss. Our gene expression findings show that radiation increases bone resorption and oxidative stress. Oxidative damage analysis indicated a higher level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the irradiated, control diet samples compared to non-irradiated mice on the control diet and suggested that dried plum may protect bones by a systemic reduction in oxidative damage. Physical characterization results that we obtained from microCT demonstrate that a dried plum diet increased the bone mass compared to the control diet, but failed to show an effect from radiation on bone. The microCT data collected is not sufficient to confirm that dried plum has a radio-protective effect in vertebrae. Although at this stage, we have limited data to fully understand the mechanisms by which dried plum protects bone, we show that dried plum can increase bone mass in vertebrae and systemically reduces MDA levels in circulation. Our research increases the current medical and biological understanding of bone physiology in response to radiation and proposed dietary countermeasures, and is of relevance to astronauts in extended space missions, cancer patients, and patients with osteoporosis.",

This concept known as “last-mile distribution” has become a major focus for humanitarian and relief groups, since there is little success in maintaining the efficacy of vaccines during the last stage of transportation. To directly address this issue, we have designed and prototyped a mobile cooler that will safely transport and distribute vaccines at their proper storage temperature of 2-8 ºC in the developing world, using thermoelectric modules as a solid-state cooling device. Through testing, the second prototype cooler was able to maintain an internal temperature of 3.3 ºC at a total power consumption of 16.1 W. This device is actively cooled, unlike current passive cooling containers that utilize ice packs in insulated boxes, unable to control temperature after being opening and closed. The device is primarily used for transportation, though it can be used for storage as long as power is available. This device is intended for young women in developing nations, specifically Uganda, susceptible to human papillomavirus (HPV), in order to deliver the full potency of the vaccine, with the intention to prevent cervical cancer outbreaks.

        "abstract": "Children suffering from Cerebral Palsy often undergo gait therapy in order to strengthen and coordinate their trunks and legs. The patients often feel unmotivated to perform their gait training because the physical movements associated with it are difficult and there is no immediate reward. Physical therapists (PT) will often play music as an incentive to get the children focused on their physical therapy, but this is inefficient and impedes the PT from analyzing and tuning the patients' gait. Mobile Music is a small device designed for automating musical therapy during gait training. In this paper, we go through several design iterations in order to create a cheap, ergonomic device that will sense motion and use musical stimulation in order to encourage active participation in gait training. While we had some difficulties implementing the motion sensing algorithm in the final device, testing done in the prototype phase showed promising results in accurately detecting participation in physical therapy. We have determined that the problems associated with these are likely due to timing issues in the microcontroller unit due to multiple reasons and the lack of feedback to the device of the audio streaming state. With the addition of a mobile application and some slight changes to the code implementation of the motion sensing algorithm, we believe that these problems can be fixed. Because of the improvement in media player control that a mobile app enables, a newer, lower powered system configuration can be implemented that reduces audio output noise as well as reduce power consumption. These improvements combined with the low cost and simple interface could make Mobile Music into a very viable product with the potential to help children with movement disorders improve their gaits.",

This project aimed to develop a method to increase the pore size of alginate-based hydrogels in a reproducible manner without compromising their structural integrity. Experimental methods included altering alginate composition using carboxymethyl cellulose or gelatin and inducing conformational changes via Mach-1TM mechanical compression. Fluorescence microscopy was used to visualize the diffusion of FITC-dextran weight markers and fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles into the microcapsules (d = 300 μm) and macrocapsules (d = 3 mm) for all experimental conditions. Based on pilot experiments, altered alginate composition did not significantly increase the pore size of alginate capsules for the modeled diffusivity range D = 1 x 10-14 m2/s to D = 1 x 10-15 m2/s. Mechanical compressions did not significantly affect the porosity or diffusivity of alginate macrocapsules (p > 0.05) under all conditions for Young’s moduli ranging from E = 76 kPa to E = 200 kPa. Based on image analysis results, it could be hypothesized that molecular weight cutoff cutoff may be increased to 500 kDa following 10 successive compressions.

Our experiments show that this software can be used to switch between types of controllers, location of controller execution, and single and multi-robot controllers. They also show that switching controllers takes 10ms, which is well within our requirements. We conclude that our system is useful in its present state for smaller projects at research institutions, or as a stepping off point for future work. To improve this system for general use, improvements beyond solely sending messages through Wi-Fi will be necessary. It is also recommended that this system be transferred from Indigo, the current distribution of ROS used, to Kinetic the newer distribution of ROS, because Indigo is nearing end of life. Despite these recommendations, the success of this project shows how important this type of system will be in continuing robotic development.",

The system was comprised of a monochrome camera and rotating filter wheel, with filters that isolated the narrow bands of wavelengths characteristic of seagrass.

To address this inequity, we have created a mobile application and imaging unit that allows for the low-cost implementation of urinalysis testing, which will aid in the detection of warning signs for prenatal health risks. From a single photo taken with a tablet camera, our application digitizes the results of a standard urinalysis test strip, displays the test results, and tracks the patient test histories. Using early, affordable urinalysis, we can increase the rates early detection, intervention, and successful pregnancies.\n Our results have shown that our solution can accurately estimate the concentrations of biological compounds found in urine when compared to visual approximations of color comparison charts. Our device is not only more efficient than the alternative, but also more efficient at screening for and detecting potentially fatal health conditions in pregnant women. Ultimately, our solution is a frugal and mobile urinalysis alternative that can feasibly be implemented in rural communities in order to increase early detection of pregnancy complications, allow for early intervention, and improve the probability of successful pregnancies.",

        "abstract": "Many Santa Clara University students have the luxury of having access to devices such as iPads and eBook readers which support many applications that make our lives easier. The numerous ways to read digital books today has significantly lowered the cost of gaining access to educational material. However, in rural developing communities in countries like India, this is not the case. Currently in India, people in some developing communities have basic mobile phones called feature phones which can perform basic functionalities such as texting, calling, and browsing the web. Feature phones are affordable and very popular in developing communities. There is currently no set standard for reading ebooks on these phones and no applications specifically designed to view books on them. Through online books, people can have access to a wealth of information from which they can obtain educational resources. Anudip and iMerit, two organizations based in India that train and employ women to make online books, work with publishers who are readily digitizing books for expensive devices such as smart phones and eReaders. These companies currently do not have a tool that allows basic feature phones to gain access to online books. As a solution, we constructed a web tool customized for Anudip and iMerit which digitizes printed text into a format viewable on basic feature phones. Our web system, MUVE, successfully converts text into Extensible Markup Language, XML, a format understood by major browsers. While there are already existing efforts to bridge the education and employment gap in rural communities through companies such as biNu, which makes apps for feature phones and allows users to download books, there are no efforts that utilize XML, a much more readable, simple, and usable language that is much easier to interpret on feature phones. (Cave, 2013) For the final step of our tool, MUVE compresses the XML data into a file available for download. We took into consideration the importance of partitioning the data files into smaller pieces so that the information can be downloaded by users who have low bandwidth connections. The final output of our completed system is a folder of XML files containing the chapters of a book. This conversion tool will be delivered and installed; however, these files need to be filtered through a simple XML interpreter. The construction of this XML interpreter will happen simultaneously with the installation of our system on the Anudip and iMerit servers in India. Ultimately, our tool will hopefully grant better access to online books through mobile phones, thereby promoting better education, and will also provide more jobs for women through employment with Anudip and iMerit.",

To compensate, modern day businesses have seen the need to collect data about how customers use their product. The development of websites has improved over the last couple of years, and with a higher demand for usability data, various companies have come up with solutions that are able to help web developers improve their websites. One of the current solutions include Mixpanel, which does a great job gathering big data from event tracking, but it doesnt include an A/B testing feature. This feature is key for a company to compare the difference of their original website or application, to another that has been modified for improvement.

Clients will be able to integrate our solution directly into their product, allowing them to leverage their existing framework.

However, it is essential to ensure that the AP does not suffer performance issues as a result of running containers. The main function of APs is to switch packets, and this function must be preserved while containers are running. In this thesis, we propose a method, NetCon, to measure packet switching delay and allow containers to run on APs only when there are available resources and low traffic.

        "advisor": "David C. Anastasiu",
        "abstract": "In the field of neural networks, there has been a long-standing problem that needs to be addressed: gaining insight into how neural networks make decisions. Neural Networks are still considered black boxes and are often difficult to understand. This lack of understanding becomes an ethical dilemma especially in the domain of self-driving cars. Given the limited number of works geared towards unravelling neural network logic for autonomous driving vehicles, our team seeks to create a novel neural network interpretability method to influence the neural network during its training process.\n Deep Neural Networks have demonstrated impressive performance in complex tasks, such as image classification and speech recognition. However, due to their multi-layer structure combined with non-linear decision boundaries, it is hard to understand what makes them arrive at a particular classification or recognition decision given new data. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to understand and interpret the reasoning in a deep neural network. In some state-of-the-art solutions, researchers try to actively improve the network during the training process through the use of penalty functions that added into the chosen layers of the model. However, in many other state of the art solutions, interpretability is done after the model is trained. This means that no modifications are made to the network until after it is fully trained. This results from this method of interpretability often take form of decision tress, extracting logical rules, or highlighting images. However, improvement will have to be done through an additional training process, meaning that more time will be taken. This is often the case with vision-based models such as those used in self-driving neural networks.\n Based on previous works done in the field of neural network interpretability, we propose adding a penalty function in the feature extraction layers of an autonomous driving neural network model rather than taking the common passive interpretability approach. Our method is intended to prevent the model from developing complex data representations that are not human-understandable. Our group specifically chose L1 regularization as our penalty function for the purpose of creating sparse feature maps that can ignore noise. Through the use of an autonomous driving simulator and feature extraction methods, we proved that our regularized model was more effective and interpretable than an baseline version of it. To determine model effectiveness, we observed the autonomy of both models. To determine interpretability, we measured the compressibility and randomness of the features learned by both models. For feature compressibility, the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm was applied from the features extracted from the model. Furthermore, the randomness of the features were calculated using entropy. Our results show that our regularized model was more autonomous and learned more compressible and less random features than the original baseline.",

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease are widespread, affecting millions of people worldwide. These diseases occur when neurons in the brain or peripheral nervous system progressively lose function and deteriorate. Current pharmacological treatments manage some of the neurological symptoms, but there is no cure yet. Interventions that mitigate or restore loss of function can fill the void until that goal is met. Light stimulation, or transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) therapy, can help treat people with neurodegenerative diseases, as it has been shown to improve sleep, attention, memory, and cognitive function.\n The objective of this project is to develop a hybrid electroencephalogram (EEG) and nearinfrared light stimulation device with a real-time, dynamic closed-loop control system. The device is designed as a research tool to study the effects of light stimulation therapy on the brain because the associated mechanism by which the effects occur is not well understood. Simultaneous stimulation of the brain and measurement of brain activity is required to answer these questions.\n We worked closely with an interdisciplinary team to design a helmet-like device and software program with integrated electrode arrays, LED arrays, cooling system, and dynamic light stimulation and EEG signal control interface for effective and comfortable delivery of light therapy. The device and control system enable the functionality to design experiments that test the assumptions of light therapy mechanisms. These types of findings will improve light therapy protocol design by providing direct evidence of the acute and long term effects of the intervention. The clinical implications for patients with neurodegenerative diseases are that light therapy may be more effectively designed and thereby improve quality of life for those suffering.",

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Dementia, and Parkinson’s affect hundreds of millions of people across the nation and world each year. While medications targeting disease pathways have often resulted in debilitating side effects, neurodegenerative diseases may be targeted by common pathways that promote healing of tissues via reduced inflammation, increased perfusion, and increased energy production. Photobiomodulation (PBM) targets all of these physiological processes with non-invasive near infra-red light stimulation and for this application the treatment will be applied to the head. Transcranial PBM has been used to effectively treat neurodegenerative diseases with improved cognitive and motor control outcomes. PBM applied to the brain causes detectable changes in brain activity, measured by electroencephalography (EEG). However, no tool exists to simultaneously implement PBM and EEG. Thus, the goal of this project was to design and prototype a hybrid PBM and EEG device. This report was created for the mechanical subsection of this project, which focuses on the integration of the EEG sensors, LED arrays, and cooling system, as well as the overall design of the helmet. The team was successfully able to create an effective cooling system through the utilization of heatsinks on the LED boards and fans attached to the OpenBCI helmet. The team was also able to successfully design and 3D print LED arrays to uniquely fit into the OpenBCI helmet, as well as a helmet shell cover. These designs allowed for the successful and safe integration of photobiomodulation into the EEG device.",

This would allow the community to receive ample water in more extreme circumstances, instead of merely average circumstances. The addition of a loop, or redundancy, would protect the integrity of the system by allowing water to be re-routed if a section of the system is compromised.",

Our team sought to improve this integral process by proving the efficacy of a new method of protein ligation using the transpeptidase Sortase A. Sortase A is known to efficiently bind two peptide fragments so long as they are attached to LPXTG motifs, which signal and activate the enzyme’s ligation abilities. Previous studies affirm Sortase A’s binding ability and efficacy in in vitro situations, however none have yet confirmed its abilities in vivo. Operating in vivo would not only allow us to take advantage of Sortase A’s binding abilities, but also the mammalian expression system’s own protein editing mechanisms, namely its high fidelity protein synthesis and post translational modification capabilities. This proof-of-concept project used Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fragments as a simple but qualitative method of measuring Sortase A’s in vivo binding abilities, causing the cells to fluoresce if the introduced GFP fragments were successfully bound together. Our team found that Sortase A does in fact have the capacity to operate in vivo, signified by fluorescence in our test subject and further confirmed by our positive and negative controls. These findings indicate a bright future for Sortase A’s role as a protein ligate, and a basis for future studies on how to further optimize and regulate its abilities to further improve protein ligation and its many applications.",

        "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disease that predominantly affects preterm infants. Of the 10% of preterm neonates that develop NEC, about one in four cases results in death. The pathophysiology presents as inflammation of intestinal epithelial cell lining and subsequent tissue death, sometimes resulting in intestinal perforations. The underlying mechanisms have yet to be comprehensively identified. Diagnosis--the rate limiting step in reducing critical disease-onset-to-treatment time--is based on relatively nonspecific signs, impeding early and accurate diagnosis. This project, a collaborative effort between Santa Clara and Stanford Universities, aims to improve current diagnostic methods by identifying the first verifiable and useful fecal biomarker for NEC. The primary molecule of interest is referenced as “Candidate-X” to protect intellectual property. Stool samples from healthy and NEC-affected infants at Stanford’s hospital, taken before and after treatment and analyzed at UC Davis, showed a strong correlation between elevated Candidate-X levels and NEC. The effects of Candidate-X and several other molecules on cell morphology were first studied in well plates seeded with either human intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC-6) or human colon cancer cells (HT-29). After HT-29 was verified as a biologically relevant cell line, two bacteria-related factors of interest, butyrate and Candidate-X, were plated with HT-29 for further study. In light of recent publications and unpublished data, Candidate-X was ultimately selected. Key results show that Candidate-X causes a comparatively high level of cell death and its effects are cell-correlated, suggesting a causative relationship between Candidate-X and NEC. Morphological changes with Candidate-X treatment reveal an unidentified cell death pathway, which will be the topic of future exploration. This paper proposes that using Candidate-X as a noninvasive fecal biomarker in combination with current methods and predictive models may improve speed and accuracy of NEC diagnosis, and outlines potential future directions for research.",

This disease has impacted billions worldwide and has led to an ever-increasing burden on the healthcare system. Over the last couple of years, researchers have improved upon conventional cancer therapy that includes chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. One novel approach is immunotherapy, which shows great potential because it has the ability to directly target cancerous cells2. This is a viable treatment because most cancers develop the ability to block immune pathways and evade the killer immune cells in what is known as cancer immune escape. One such pathway that is inhibited during the progression of specific cancers is the PD-L1 and PD-1 pathway thus inhibiting this pathway can be an effective treatment of advanced cancers3. To improve upon the efficacy of certain immunotherapies, we engineered a novel delivery method using exosomes to target this specific pathway. We focused on exosomes due to the nanovesicles ability to penetrate tissue better, the longer half-life of the treatment, and the biocompatibility of naturally derived vesicles. To complete this task, we focused on successfully integrating our exosomes expression vector in HEP-G2 and HK-2 cell lines. Next, we verified production of the engineered exosomes through the process of cotransfection using a known exosome-specific marker vector. Our results are valuable as they prove successful exosome plasmid vector integration. Furthermore, our study is a proof of concept that exosomes can be manipulated to express surface proteins; having the potential of interrupting immune evading pathways of numerous diseases.",

Currently this technology is not being implemented in a way such that a user can practically interact with it in a way where users can actually use what is generated to improve their lives. We introduce OliveAI to explore a possible implementation of generative AI technology that users can practically and usefully interact with. OliveAI is a web app where users can provide a desired type of food (e.g. Pasta, Pizza, Cookies, etc.) and a list of ingredients which, once submitted, are processed through two different machine learning models on the backend to produce an original, completely AI generated recipe complete with instructions, ingredients, a title, and a picture of what the finished product could look like. Due to the computational complexity of this implementation and the difficulty of navigating two separate latent spaces OliveAI can generate some strange results, but oftentimes it does successfully generate a picture and recipe combination that matches with what the user provided. We believe we have successfully explored a new form of generative machine learning projects, where users interact with these models to better their lives in a practical day-to-day use kind of way.

Some mobile and desktop apps have tired to address individual issues of the restaurant dining process, but there is no single platform that attempts to fix the experience as a whole. We begin by outlining the idea behind OmniSplit, a small to medium business solution that seeks to address many of these issues simultaneously. OmniSplit combines online food payments, individual item ratings, and splitting the check all in one system. We implemented a web application for restaurant staff members and an iOS app for restaurant customers. With the web application, restaurant staff can customize their menu and re- spond to incoming orders and payments. The platform can be expanded on in the future to include additional features, such as the ability to add images to a menu. The iOS app allows users to see the menus of restaurants hosted on OmniSplit, and gives them the option to order food in a group with their friends. At the end of ordering, users can leave ratings for the food they ate. We discuss what we can add in the future to expanding our system, including the ability to tip, ability to refund payments, and a way to view restaurant analytics.

By analyzing time series, researchers can query, cluster, summarize, and segment relevant time series to identify and model behaviors of subjects that inform future decisions for end-users like manufacturers or service providers. Specifically, researchers can utilize an offline, iterative dynamic programming algorithm that optimally partitions a given batch of multivariate time series data into segments with central patterns; these patterns not only capture the overall behavior of a stored time series, but also allow researchers to track changes in the input batch’s underlying behavior.\n As the speed of collecting Big Data increases, however, the mentioned offline batch-processing algorithm that serially runs is not fast enough for streamed, real-time multivariate time series data. While current research has developed online streaming segmentation algorithms, which can immediately handle streamed-in data, these algorithms semantically segment streamed-in time series, failing to produce central patterns usually obtained from offline batch-processing segmentation algorithms.\n To address the issues mentioned above, I implemented an online, parallel algorithm which produces prototypical patterns that capture the overall behavior of streamed-in time series. The algorithm receives streamed-in minibatches as its input, creating distinct, acceptable units of data to efficiently analyze. The method also smooths the transition between the patterns generated across subsequent minibatches.",

Traditionally, physical therapists use visual observation methods to assess patient progress throughout the recovery process. If a patient injures their shoulder, for example, a physical therapist might assess their recovery after a month of physical therapy by comparing their current range of shoulder motion to that immediately after the injury occurred. While these methods provide some insight, they also often lack accuracy and precision, decreasing the physician’s ability to determine the true progress achieved by the patient. Currently, a professional may be able to roughly estimate the flexion angle of the elbow, or the range of rotation of the shoulder, but such an ability requires years of training and experience. The objective of this research is to design a wearable optical strain sensor to track the physical movements of the upper extremities. Our goal is to design a sensor that can accurately monitor slight movements while also being immune to electromagnetic interference, so it is compatible for use in MRI machines. We intend for the device to be capable of determining both the direction and magnitude of a movement. Our optical PDMS sensor will provide wavelength-multiplexed spatial data with a single input and output, hence enabling simpler human-wearable device interfacing.

Using a 0.25 L anode chamber, graphite electrodes and a sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene based fluoropolymercopolymer proton exchange membrane the galvanic cell was constructed. In response to constraints, the design plan was modified to include testing bacteria outside of the MFC and constructing a bulk liquid model at steady state comparing the time when maximum power output occurs in batch and continuous stirred tank reactor configurations assuming Monod growth.\n As determined by experimental results the enzymatic degradation of urea follows first order kinetics with k = 0.0055 min-1. The results of the bulk liquid model show that a batch reactor configuration is recommended for future laboratory work, as maximum power output will occur at 28.8 hours for an initial urea concentration of 2 g/ L, compared to 33 hours for the continuous stirred tank reactor. Of significance is the comparison of the reactor configurations operating at 1 g/ L considered to be the physiological uremic concentration: the time to reach maximum power is approximately seven times for the batch (331.3 hours) versus CSTR (50 hours).

We were also able to establish which coatings result in a more consistent cross-linking composition.

        "abstract": "Hundreds of thousands of individuals in the United States suffer from chronic kidney disease and must receive some form of treatment. There are two therapy options for treating kidney failure: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Both methods restrict the mobility of the user and require several hours to complete. The differences between these methods are the cost, efficiency and patient mobility. Peritoneal dialysis is more affordable than hemodialysis, but because it does not require blood contact, is less efficient as a treatment. However, hemodialysis requires much specialized equipment that is only located at a certified dialysis facility. Peritoneal dialysis is much less invasive and can be done at the patient’s home. The following project details a prototype packed bed reactor that would supplement current peritoneal dialysis treatments. The packed bed reactor utilizes an encapsulated enzyme (urease in alginate) in order to degrade a toxin, urea, found in the dialysis fluid (or dialysate). This device would be externally attached to the patient and aim to recycle the dialysate to increase the overall efficiency of peritoneal dialysis treatments. Both mechanical tests conducted on alginate and enzymatic tests on encapsulated urease separately showed promising results and allowed for initial packed bed reactor prototype testing. Enzyme activity is unimpaired, but capsule integrity decreases under physiological conditions over time. To improve capsule lifespan, a different divalent cation (BaCl2) was tested alongside the control of CaCl2. Preliminary results seem to indicate that BaCl2 does increase lifespan and does not affect enzyme activity. Replicate experiments will need to be performed to confirm these findings.",

There are four main steps that go into manufacturing a PCB once it is fully designed which are: milling, solder dispensing, component placement, and a reflow process. The goal will be to create various toolheads and place them onto a single platform allowing the user to perform the aforementioned production processes. After the design and manufacturing of these toolheads, functionality of the system was tested. Although single components of the system work, the entire system is not currently able to function in synchrony. This means there is still a lot of user input for the system such as having to use outdated operating systems, place the components in the component tray and move the board three times throughout the process.",

The Pedal 4 Purification is a product that addresses this need by utilizing pre-existing bicycle infrastructure and local freshwater sources to allow people to purify their own drinking water on a daily basis. Attachable to any standard bicycle, the Pedal 4 Purification product consists of pump, purification, cart and adjustable kickstand subsystems that allow the operator to pump, purify and transport 40L of potable water. Pedaling at the reasonable rate of 60 rpm will provide the optimal flow rate of 1.54L/min through the filter. At this rate, it would take the operator 26 minutes to provide enough drinking water to satiate 20 people for the day. As a result of the drastic reduction in the time and effort it takes for individuals to obtain drinking water, target communities will have more free time allowing them to focus on other pressing issues. Use of the Pedal 4 Purification product results in a 266% increase in user time savings as well as 54 times the amount of water collected per minute of user exertion compared to traditional methods. The Pedal 4 Purification team travelled to San Andres Itzapa, Guatemala to manufacture the entire device at Maya Pedal, an NGO that creates ‘bicimaquinas’ to help provide its local community members with basic human resource infrastructure. After the manufacturing process was complete, the team and Maya Pedal workers drove to the highland community of Patzun to implement the design and instruct the local people about how to use it. User feedback was noted after the successful implementation in the developing community of Patzun.",

Dr. Steven T. Woolson prototyped a device to enable surgeons to better align the prosthetic acetabular component, thereby reducing the rate of postsurgical hip dislocations, which he named the Pel-vise. The overarching goal of the senior design project was to improve upon the Pel-vise design and produce a functional prototype.\n By conducting an extensive literature review and interviewing nurses, surgeons, and patients, the team improved upon the Pel-vise using the iterative design cycle. The final deliverable to Dr. Woolson was a SolidWorks model of the redesigned Pel-vise.

Phosphate is a natural chemical, but toxic in large concentrations; detection is therefore important to avoid drinking contaminated water. Despite this fact, no cheap, and/or nontoxic system for phosphate detection is yet on the market.\n The detection system utilizes a paper-based microfluidic device to automate the electrochemical detection process, which normally requires expert use of lab equipment. When combined with a portable potentiostat that works with a mobile app, the device will allow untrained users to determine if any source of drinking water contains unsafe levels of phosphate without equipment or training, and to communicate that information to a central database for further analysis. Those of any background, particularly in developing countries, will be able to maintain health and raise awareness about clean water.\n Microfluidic devices are useful tools for the detection of water contaminants, but there is a gap in technology for the detection of phosphate. Our phosphate detection system is a paper-based microfluidic device with an already-developed voltammetry device that automates the detection process so that any user can safely find phosphate in water. The system will provide a binary analysis about whether the water is safe to consume or not. Completion of the project provides a valuable tool to both average customers in developing countries and scientific researchers in determining the safety of drinking water.",

        "abstract": "As the world population rises, there is an increase in agricultural production, which has compromised safe water consumption for many demographics. Phosphate, a compound commonly used in agriculture fertilizers, leaks into local water sources contaminating the resource for its consumers1. Since high levels of phosphate lead to osteoporosis, kidney damage and digestive issues in humans as well as eutrophication and destruction of natural ecosystems, the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States has limited phosphate levels to 25 parts per billion in lakes and reservoirs2,3. To combat the issue of phosphate contamination, widespread testing is necessary in affected areas, however current testing methods are expensive, off-site and time consuming. Since affected areas mainly comprise of developing nations, there is a need for an affordable and user-friendly phosphate testing platform. With our research, we present an affordable, rapid, user-friendly, and sensitive electrochemical phosphate sensor that has the ability to test water samples and provide immediate nutrient diagnosis.\n The electrochemical sensor is composed of a three-electrode system and utilizes voltammetry for the detection of phosphate. The working, counter and reference electrodes are printed in carbon, platinum, and silver ink respectively onto a glass substrate. The sensor is then connected to an electrochemical analyzer which will apply voltammetry with a voltage range from 0.6 V to -0.3 V and a voltage scan rate of 1 V/s. Current peaks are then analyzed and correspond to the concentration of phosphate in the tested solution. From test experiments with our sensor, phosphate concentrations as low as 10 parts per billion are detectable.\n The sensor will combine with a hand-held portable potentiostat and a mobile application to enhance the user-friendliness, speed, and affordability of phosphate detection in water. Our device has the ability to accurately test phosphate concentration in water samples and effectively communicate the results to its users. This rapid detection system contributes to improved water sanitation and global health.",

        "abstract": "Deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) have proven capable at generating diverse, photorealistic images of human faces, but it is difficult and often time-consuming to choose what kind of image these generative adversarial networks (GANs) produce. We create a simple, intuitive web application through which users may write a description of a human face in plain text and generate photos that appear to match the given description. In this paper, we show how text can be used to direct the output of a conditional GAN with a DCGAN architecture. While our images did somewhat resemble human faces, they often had artifacts that prevented them from looking like photographs, but they did generally match the input text descriptions. This was likely due to our using a relatively simple DCGAN architecture and trained for a relatively short amount of time. To improve image quality, we recommend experimenting with more advanced GAN architectures trained for a longer amount of time. While a more advanced GAN would likely take longer to train, more advanced models would likely achieve more photorealistic results. To make the model more robust to natural language input, we recommend implementing a text-embedding model to encode the text data that is passed to the GAN.",

        "abstract": "In the past decade, the personal ownership of unmanned aerial vehicles has exploded in the US and around the world. The rapidly declining size and cost of integrated circuits, sensors and embedded micro-controllers has lead to a flourishing community of hobbyists designing flight controllers with levels of sophistication approaching those for government and military applications. The typical flight assisted controllers integrate data from the user's control system and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in order to keep the craft level and on course. Deriving mostly from the radio controlled (RC) hobby industry, the flight control technologies for both rotary and fixed wing systems are generally community-built and open source. While this leads to rapid development and ease of modification, quality usually suffers. Because the community is not a community of professionals, best coding practices are often left behind, leading to unexpected failures. Such flight control systems are unsuitable for integration into US airspace due to their failure-prone nature and inability to mitigate the failure of flight control surfaces. Fixed wing systems can also be controlled without an onboard flight controller or autopilot, with a simple camera downlink and direct control surface control being sufficient for most firrst-person video (FPV) needs. This has left a hole in the market for such controllers, with all offerings lacking in professional features such as redundancy and failure mitigation. Our project suffered from many setbacks, including one team member becoming ill and another leaving the project halfway into development. We were also hampered by our choice to use the brand new STM32Cube Hardware Abstraction Layer (described in more detail in Chapter 9), as 3rd party support and example code was nonexistent or conflicting with official documentation. As such, we were required to greatly reduce the featureset of our system. To compensate for this, we implemented a basic software plugin system, where future developers can code their own flight modes and recompile the software without having to revisit the basic I/O required to setup and access the onboard sensors and actuators. Looking forward, we believe we have solved many of the issues involved with developing a flight controller on this powerful, next-gen platform. We have implemented basic IMU-based flight stabilization and control, and future developers can easily code in the more premium features, such as GPS and telemetry, on top of the existing foundation.",

In this work, we describe the use of tandem mass spectrometry to identify specific residues that are auto-modified in both PARP14 and PARP15 as well as their preferred modification sites on their shared target, PARP13. Peptide fragment screening of these potential proximal sites was performed using TLC-MALDI-TOF to isolate the minimal proximal motifs required for PARP family member-specific labeling. From these efforts, we identified a 6 amino-acid fragment of a PARP14 specific peptide target that retains selective modification. We further describe the chemical modification of this peptide to derive biomimetics that aims to selectively inhibit individual PARP family members specifically PARP14.",

        "abstract": "Porous concrete is a special kind of concrete that has high porosity. The only difference between porous concrete and normal concrete is that a porous concrete mix does not consist of sand or other small particles. The lack of sand and small particles creates voids in the concrete. The voids that area created are the reason why water is able to pass through a porous concrete mix. Porous concrete is used for low traffic areas such as parking lots and pavements. The main purpose of porous concrete is to reduce or even eliminate storm water runoff which has a number of benefits.\n For this project, the team developed a porous pavement mixture that will be applicable for practical and real life use. This means that the porous concrete mixture must have a certain permeability and compressive strength.\n There were two main parts to the project. Initially the team found what value of water to cement ratio would give the highest possible compression strength. The team started with experimenting with water to cement ratio due to the fact that it is the only variable that affects compressive strength and barely, if at all, affects permeability. After figuring out what the best water to cement ratio was, the next part of the project was about experimenting with other variables that affect the permeability and compression strength of a porous concrete.\n After acquiring the best water to cement ratio for the highest compression strength, the second part of the experiment will consist of varying two other variables, which were aggregate size and types of aggregate. By optimizing these variables, an optimal porous concrete mixture was found that could be used for practical use. The hope was to find a mixture that can be used for either pavements or parking lots.",

Moreover, since the field is relatively new, few scientists are trained in microfluidic chip design and microfabrication. Eliminating the peripheral equipment from standard testing protocol will allow mLSI to be used in point-of-care settings and more widespread usage of this powerful technology.

        "abstract": "Cancer is a highly prevalent disease that affects millions of people worldwide. In addition to the physiological effects of the disease, cancer patients are more likely to be diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Unfortunately, prior research has shown that MDD can also decrease the efficacy of radiotherapy cancer treatments. Currently, there is no way to predict, prevent, or mitigate this comorbidity, preventing physicians from administering supplemental therapies. In this paper, we propose a low-cost and efficient computational tool that can be utilized to quantify a patient’s likelihood of developing depression. To do so, we used PET images and a ResNet34 architecture to train a convolutional neural network to identify depression biomarkers in the brain. These brain PET images were taken from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and also provided information regarding the patient’s depression at the time of the scan. We were then able to label and classify images in our dataset based off of this data. Although our model only yielded an accuracy of 54.25%, sensitivity of 56.25% and a specificity of 53.64%, a visual evaluation of our results (GradCAM) confirmed that our algorithm was able to detect the correct regions of interest in the brain, where depression biomarkers were found. This leads us to believe that our deep learning model, with improvement, can be used to effectively help classify depression progression rates in radiotherapy patients.",

In this report we describe efforts that represent the ground work to develop a predictive neurotoxicity model to test developmental toxicity on early neuronal differentiation from drugs and toxins for human consumption or exposure. Developmental toxins are toxins that prevent stem cell differentiation into neurons by impacting neural development [2] . Currency technologies used to evaluate a compound's potential as a developmental toxin are centered around culturing stem cells in a two-dimensional environment or exposing animal models to the compound. The stem cells are then monitored for changes in proliferation, differentiation, and death. These classes of experiments proved not only to be expensive, but also extremely time consuming and ineffective in some cases. These technologies do not accurately mimic the in vivo environment, which uses ECM proteins and cell-cell interactions to regulate cellular functions such as migration, apoptosis, and gene expression. Our predictive model would provide a more biologically accurate alternative of the human system compared to two-dimensional cell culture and animal models. Our model would further improve the quality and relevance of developmental neurotoxicity research, reduce the number of animal experiments and overall cost to evaluate the potential for a compound to act as a developmental toxin.",

The objective is to grow the CNTs with little or no damage to the graphene underlayer. We start with fabricating test structures using both plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and thermal CVD throughout the CNT growth process to confirm the results of previous work of our research group. We then proceed to design a process to grow CNTs using PECVD in order to achieve a test structure with not only vertically aligned CNTs, but also a conductive graphene underlayer. In order to achieve this, we vary the plasma conditions within the reactor during the CNT growth process and analyze the fabricated test structure using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a wafer probe station. Through our analysis we are able to determine the viability of our designed process. We are able to produce a test structure with partially aligned CNTs and an intact graphene underlayer by lowering the DC voltage of the plasma used in the PECVD process. As a result, we find that resistance of the sample is comparable to that of plain graphene.

        "abstract": "One principal energy source that is underutilized in the world today is solar energy. While the United States has tried to make a push for reusable and 'green' energy sources, these sources are frequently overlooked in developing nations. While the set up costs of solar energy may be expensive due to installation and the high cost of certain parts, the savings over time is well worth the initial cost. In many developing nations large areas of the country are off of the power grid or have inconsistent power. One way to help people living in these areas is by introducing the use of solar power. Unfortunately one major drawback to using solar energy is the difficulty of storing it. While photovoltaic panels can store energy in batteries, they are extremely expensive and inefficient. Using solar collectors that are either manufactured or handmade rather than PV panels can be more than four times as efficient and cost much less. The one negative issue with solar collectors is that they will only work when the sun is out. The 2011 to 2012 Project Omoverhi team's goal was to utilize this energy from solar collectors and store it in a thermal storage container. The stored energy could then be used when direct sunlight was not available. Using paraffin wax as a phase change material because of its melting temperature and excellent storage properties, Project Omoverhi was able to achieve this goal and create an affordable, easy to use system that can be attached to a solar collector. The system was tested to determine if it would enable an incubator to keep a steady temperature that would meet the requirements of a premature infant or successfully hatch chicken eggs. Data collected showed that Project Omoverhi's design is an effective way to store heat and energy from a solar collector so that it can be utilized as needed.",

        "abstract": "The goal of the Mars Rover Crash Vehicle Test Article is to act as an impact-absorbing crumple-zone structure that protects a Mars Rover in the case of failure of other landing systems. This crash vehicle was designed for free-applications to absorb drops from different heights due to its modular crumple zone system. The design utilized readily available and recycled materials to create a low-cost, quick-build-time, modular system.\n The design was split into two subsystems-the Crumple Zone and Inner Vessel-that would be placed inside and around the Outer Frame. The Crumple Zone underwent various iterations with the final design being columns of aluminum cans at the four corners of the Outer Frame. The Inner Vessel consisted of shock absorbers mounted to the sides of the Outer Frame that held the platform on which the Mars Rover would rest.\n This scaled down design underwent three drop tests from a height of three meters. The first two tests utilized 144 aluminum cans for a maximum crumpling distance of 40.64 cm. These tests saw very little plastic deformation in the Crumple Zone and a 15 cm bounce after ground-impact, leading to the discovery of unwanted friction within the system. Additionally, the recorded acceleration data only gave a maximum acceleration of 6.28 g’s when 30 were expected due to the accelerometers only recorded at a sampling rate of 14 Hz and not the expected 250 Hz. Because of these errors in these tests, the system and testing procedure were modified for a third test.\n The third test saw the system mass increase by 22.6 kg, a Crumple Zone of 72 cans of 20.32 cm maximum crumpling distance, and a maximum sampling rate setting of 1250 Hz. Although only 52 Hz were achieved, the system behaved as expected, and recorded an acceleration of 21.02 g’s, had no rebound, and absorbed 17.73J per can. The successes from this test indicate that scaling up this design is cost-effective and feasible for a Mars Rover with a mass upwards of 1000 kg.",

This lander was designed to be used as the last stage of landing in the existing entry, descent, and landing procedures used in previous Mars missions. The design improved upon past missions to Mars by reducing risk of failure during landing by utilizing a passive system with no electronics or control systems while also increasing landing site accuracy. These goals were accomplished by incorporating external crushable materials and internal damping systems. Five drop tests of our final design were completed. The test results can be used for scaling the components of the modular design to suit different planet conditions. Our scaled down test article design absorbed 7.40% of the energy absorbed by the previous Mars landing systems. The remote-controlled vehicle payload we used survived all of our tests. To scale up our design for a Spirit sized mission, we recommend using a crushable material design with 350 cylinders with the dimensions of 0.06 m radius, 0.00196 m thickness, and 0.1377 m height. Our design can be used for multiple payload landing applications, including care packages and supply deliveries.",

        "abstract": "Bioluminescence is the ability of naturally occurring organisms to emit light. Many instances of bioluminescence have been identified ranging from fireflies to bacteria. The protein responsible for bioluminescence in all of these organisms is luciferase. The exact function and structure of this protein are still unknown to this day. This project aims at better understanding luciferase as well as enhancing its bioluminescent properties. In order to work with luciferase, we had to isolate all of the genes necessary for bioluminescence. The six genes necessary for bioluminescence are Lux A,B,C,D,E,G. We isolated each of these genes from original bacterial DNA. We then put these genes back together into our own synthesized plasmids through a method called Gibson Assembly. These plasmids were then mutated through a process called site-directed mutagenesis. The mutated plasmids were introduced to E.coli cells and mutated protein were produced and screened for enhanced bioluminescent properties. We were able to successfully isolate all of the DNA fragments necessary for bioluminescence. We were then able to successfully create one of the two plasmids necessary for bioluminescence. The successful creation of this plasmid shows that we were able to successfully isolate and combine the DNA fragments. By shifting a few small experimental parameters we should be able to complete our second plasmid and achieve bioluminescence, and move onto mutating the DNA. Luciferase doesn’t have many applications in today’s world because it remains so understudied. By mutating luciferase, we hope to shed some light on this protein and allow it to be widely used. One possible application is being explored by a company called the Glowing Plant Project, located in San Francisco. They are using the luciferase and inserting it into plant genomes to create glow in the dark plants. These have some amazing promise not just aesthetically in our gardens but also as a potential light source for third world and developing countries.",

Up to this point, the testbeds that do exist for testing multi-robot controllers are often expensive, hard to deploy, and typically constrained to a single plane of motion. These constraints limit the capacity to conduct research which is why team Autonomously Controlled Electromechanical Systems (ACES) has created the PVCROV system. PVCROV is a low cost, underwater platform for testing multi-robot control systems. By utilizing an underwater environment, ACES created a testbed that is not constrained to a single plane of motion. Additionally, the advantage of an underwater testbed is the ability to simulate weightlessness, as if in a space environment. Both of these features make this testbed extremely valuable to multi-robot research as they open the door for conducting experiments that previously could not be performed. ACES final product consisted of four PVCROV's tethered to a surface buoy with wireless command and control via an 'onshore' control computer. Each system was designed, simulated, manufactured and tested based on requirements developed from a customer needs survey performed with the targeted research team. Although complete functionality was not achieved, a new team of students has started a new iteration of the development process which will bring the system up to full functionality. With graduate student experimenters already involved, ACES has created a testbed that will provide great value to the robotics research program at SCU.",

        "abstract": "In certain terrain types It is difficult to locate people, objects, animals, etc. In particular, using one’s eyes and ears to locate something has certain disadvantages. Visible light propagates at high frequencies and is easily stopped by terrain. Also, sound waves do not propagate as effectively as electromagnetic waves in open air because they are mechanical waves. Therefore, our goal is to create a system that can locate emitters that output electromagnetic waves in the radio frequency (RF) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). RF operates at a lower frequency than visible light and will diffract around mountains and pass through jungle foliage more easily than light. The goal of this project is to design a system that will be compact, lightweight, and provide a signal strength/clock direction output pair to the operator indicating where the target emitter is located. Thus far we have been able to design and build a prototype system that accomplishes most of our goals. Tests with our prototype system have shown that our design concept is realizable given our system is lightweight and provides the operator with a bearing and signal strength of a target emitter. However, due to issues with our motor and motor controller, our system is unable to achieve our desired accuracy. Overall, the predominant issues we have encountered are our motor controller and motor being too weak to rotate our antenna. This issue may be remedied by increasing our budget slightly and incorporating a more powerful motor and better quality motor controller. Given the incorporation of an improved motor controller and motor, our system should be able to meet all of our original design objectives and be finalized into a compact usable product.",

These agencies, like the Thousand Oaks Police Department and California State Parks Department, are looking to use UAS technology to survey large areas of land at an affordable cost with limited need for human interaction for increased agent safety. To meet some of the needs of these agencies, the project team developed two critical subsystems: a pneumatic launch system for fixed-wing unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) and companion software with vegetation feature recognition and autonomous flight firmware and hardware. These subsystems were demonstrated with the use of an o↵-the-shelf UAV that was modified to interface with the launch system and to house all the necessary electronics for flight and data gathering. The UAS was developed to be easily transported, to be setup and operable by a small team, and to be produced for a cost below $5000. The project team was able to demonstrate prototypical functionality of the launch and software systems. The pneumatic launcher is capable of accelerating the projected weight of a UAV to its necessary lift velocity, 25 ft/s for the UAV used in this project, to achieve flight. The feature recognition software is capable of identifying vegetation and calculating real-world locations to use in planning future missions. The work done for this project is prototypical and can benefit from improvements to the subsystems. The project team recommends making further design iterations to the launch system to be compatible with more fixed-wing UAVs and to increase the safety of the pressure system. Further testing is necessary to prove the functionality of the launcher to reliably launch a full-scale fixed-wing UAV. The feature recognition software can be improved to detect specific types of vegetation and to execute during flight for more advanced autonomous control of the UAV.",

With the rise of technology, people are looking for faster and easier ways to get to the places they want to be with as little hassle as possible. Whether it be a group of friends trying to find their buddy at a music festival, a 20 something looking for her favorite stand at the farmer's market, or a mother making sure her child doesn't wander too far from the park, accuracy and the ability to scan the environment are key factors in finding a user's destination. Location service apps require strong data connections and constant monitoring of the screen to find a location that is usually inaccurate.\n The current methods of finding locations are pretty straight forward yet meant for large scale directions and offer few solutions for finding a moving target. The user goes onto their phone and looks up the location they want to go to on Google maps for example, and then is given directions that they must constantly look at on their phone so they know the right direction to go. This approach is both troublesome and dangerous, especially for drivers who must constantly look at their phone to know which turn to take endangering their lives and the people around them. Additionally, maps applications can be very inaccurate especially in crowded and condensed areas where GPS services rarely ever work. If friends are moving around, they must constantly drop pins and send text messages to attempt to locate each other which can be very difficult in a crowded atmosphere. When finding friends or locations in crowded areas, people want to be alert and observant, not have their nose buried in their smartphone.\n Our solution uses multiple location services on a cell phone paired with a smartwatch to easily and accurately find people or locations while still being able to enjoy the environment around the user. We will create an application that communicates with another user's phone or a GPS location and then sends data to their smartwatch which will easily and discreetly point the user in the right direction. The application will use GPS paired with bluetooth technology and wifi triangulation to accurately locate the user's destination. Our plan is to feature a compass on the screen of the watch that points the user in the direction of their target or the sequence of turns to take if in a big city. We will also include a vibration system which will vibrate faster as the user gets closer to their target, much like an avalanche victim detection system. This solution will not only create an easy way to find friends but also allow the user to experience the new place they are in while also feeling their way around.",

This creates a challenge for civil engineers to improve the efficiency of the traffic intersection systems. Our team worked on this issue by building a system to improve traffic intersection analysis by video camera to count cars using multiple camera angles at a single intersection. By providing better real-time traffic network analysis, civil engineers can more accurately monitor the efficiency of traffic intersections and then make better predictions for timing changes in traffic light signaling. The novelty of our project comes from using state of the field machine learning vehicle counting algorithms for a single camera and then modifying them to work across an Internet of Things (IoT) network of devices for multiple camera angles across a single intersection. We achieved fast processing speeds on the Nvidia Jetson NX IoT devices by utilizing quantization of the object detection YOLO algorithms to be able to process video input in real time. Another improvement from current video-camera based solutions is using multiple camera angles in a network to reduce vehicle counting inaccuracy from camera obstruction from a single perspective. For future work, our project can be improved by working on the re-identification of cars when the tracking is lost, and at crowded intersections where exclusive regions of interest for intersection paths are hard to define.",

RealSense cameras are data collection devices, often times the continuity of that data is extremely important and any downtime is to be avoided. Physical resets require someone on scene to unplug and plug back in each failing camera. This can be time consuming and ultimately costly. Often the data collected by the camera is operated on in a location thousands of miles from the actual physical location of the camera. In order to solve this problem we designed a interface Printed Circuit Board (PCB) that can be controlled via secure shell (SSH) from anywhere in the world and switch the power to the camera using a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). This particular board has a capacity of five RealSense cameras operating independently. After considerable design and manufacturing the boards did not pass the functionality test. Power control performs as intended, however, the SuperSpeed signal lines that pass the data from the RealSense through the PCB did not function as intended causing the cameras themselves to not function.",

A Road Diet refers to the replacement of vehicle lanes with bicycle lanes and a center turning lane, in order to create safe zones for cyclists and drivers on the same street. While the Road Diet sufficiently addressed the safety issues of the corridor, it severely worsened its traffic capacity, creating long queues along Pruneridge and on Lawrence Expressway during peak traffic hours as residents around the area commute to and from work. The queues are so long that many drivers decide to run red lights to avoid waiting additional cycles, introducing a new set of safety concerns. Pedestrians also had to deal with cars speeding through righthand turns between Pruneridge and Lawrence, because the visibility on the curb is very low at night. Finally, the center turn lane that was implemented on Pruneridge is very underutilized during peak hours, and that space could be used for something more efficient or useful than a suicide lane. This project aims to address the problems that the Road Diet introduced and some preexisting issues while maintaining the bike lanes to provide safety and encourage cycling in the area.",

This is much wider than sections farther north as there are much higher traffic volumes in the spread out South Bay. As a result, El Camino Real can be dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. Along with pedestrian safety concerns, our project goes into the inadequate service levels for public transit, the VTA 522El Camino Real Rapid Bus in particular. Our redesign of El Camino Real was inspired by the VTA’s BRT, Bus Rapid Transit, which converts 1 of 3 car lanes into a Bus Only lane and adds a bike lane. We created several alternative design options for the project and discuss each option’s strengths and weaknesses. After we decided on a design, we ran a Synchro simulation to see how the traffic conditions would be affected by our redesign. We noted the different service levels and safety improvements.",

        "advisor": "Zhiwen Zhang",
        "abstract": "Firefly luciferase is a bioluminescent protein commonly used as a bioluminescent tag in biological studies and applications. However, because the protein is fairly large in size, it is sometimes larger than the molecules it is intended to measure and is therefore not a sufficient tag in smaller applications. The active site of firely luciferase is also not well understood, making it difficult to engineer the protein without affecting its bioluminescent activity. In this paper, we discuss the experimental methods of Reverse Protein Engineering: a bioengineering technology that reduces the size of a protein while retaining its original function. This involves subcloning a core section of the protein, attaching a DNA library to the core to achieve a large pool of randomized peptide variants, and screening those variants for any bioluminescent properties. Successful conduction of this technique would achieve two goals: 1) create a peptide alternative to resolve the protein’s current size limitations and 2) confirm the importance of specific amino acids that might contribute to the active site’s activity. Our experiments show that Reverse Protein Engineering can be done to decrease the size of Firefly Luciferase (550 amino acids) to a much smaller peptidic version of the protein (less than 80 amino acids). However, to determine successful function of the peptide variants, more research in screening the peptides for bioluminescent activity needs to be done. In addition, Reverse Protein Engineering with a different range of amino acids within the core could further the chances of achieving a successful bioluminescent peptide variant of firefly luciferase.",

        "abstract": "From the Amazon Prime Air drone delivery service to the usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in military operations, recent years have seen the development of autonomous flight technologies becoming one of the major research topics in the drone industry. Tracking the geographic position of drones is a crucial part of any autonomous flight, but the common methods of drone location tracking either have too large of an error margin or require extensive environmental setup. The aforementioned issues are major roadblocks in the advancement of autonomous flight operations. The proposed solution is a new and improved method to track the location of a drone relative to a single reference point. This method will not require any environmental setup and offers a greater degree of precision than the commonly used Global Positioning System (GPS). The designed proof of concept model, which is a completely modular and self-reliant radio-frequency (RF) based location tracking system, was built to show the viability of this new drone tracking method. The tracking system can determine the relative location of a radio-frequency source with only one receiver module. By requiring only one receiver, this tracking system eliminates the need to set up a triangulation zone. Additionally, optimizing the tracking system to generate a location from the RF telemetry signals needed in user-drone communication, the solution effectively presents an efficient manner to track a drone without the need for additional attachments. The proposed solution introduces a novel method that has the potential to vastly improve autonomous flight development and push it to full realization and fruition.",

While Santa Clara Civil Engineering Senior Design Teams have been working in this community since 2008, it was not until 2013 that a project team attempted to design a pedestrian footbridge. After the 20152016 project team decided to take on the project, it became clear from talking with the Ghanaian Municipal Engineers and local community members that the steel suspension bridge proposed by the 2013 team would not meet all the needs of the community. Therefore, the team redesigned the bridge, proposing a steel girder bridge that meets the needs of the community. The bridge is 120 feet in length with a maximum width of 5 feet. The components of the bridge include the following: spread footings for the foundation, four circular columns each with a concrete column cap, six W16x40 I beams, metal decking spanning the full length of the bridge with concrete infill, a railing system with poles every five feet and chain link fence in between the poles, and finally all connections excluding the connection between the concrete column cap and the bottom flange of the Ibeam. The design and detailing of these components is described herein, along with the assumptions made during the design process, the feedback received from the community, the ethics that governed the project decisions, and suggested work for the future of the project as a whole.",

The soils report was utilized in order to create a general cross-section that was modeled using the GEO-Slope program. From the initial analysis of the levee section, three remedial designs were created. These designs include: a seepage berm, cutoff wall, and toe drain. The remedial designs were based off of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Design and Construction of Levees, prepared in April 2000, see Appendix A. It was determined that the seepage berm was the best choice for this particular levee section due to the cost and ease of construction and available space to install the berm. The cutoff wall was determined to be too expensive and difficult to construct due to the depth required to remediate the failure mode(s). If space is not available, a toe drain is recommended as the design solution.",

Currently there are very few tools that can be used by these teams to aid them in gathering important information about the situation that allow members to stay at a safe distance. SAFER, Search and Find Emergency Rover, is an unmanned, remotely operated vehicle that can provide early reconnaissance to search and rescue teams so they may have more information to prepare themselves for the dangers that lay inside the wreckage. Over the past year, this team has restored a bare, non-operational chassis inherited from Roverwerx 2012 into a rugged and operational rover with increased functionality and reliability. SAFER uses a 360-degree camera to deliver real time visual reconnaissance to the operator who can remain safely stationed on the outskirts of the disaster. With strong drive motors providing enough torque to traverse steep obstacles and enough power to travel at up to 3 ft/s, SAFER can cover ground quickly and effectively over its 1-3 hour battery life, maximizing reconnaissance for the team. Additionally, SAFER contains 3 flashing beacons that can be dropped by the operator in the event a victim is found so that when team members do enter the scene they may easily locate victims. In the future, other teams may wish to improve upon this iteration by adding thermal imaging, air quality sensors, and potentially a robotic arm with a camera that can see in spaces too small for the entire rover to enter.",

        "abstract": "Large cities like San Francisco can experience congested streets and crowded sidewalks. Increasing bike ridership has been shown to alleviate some of these pains, but they are currently being undersupported. In order to properly account for the growing cyclist population, more efficient bike storage solutions need to be made available. Current bike racks take up too much space, are not reasonably theft resistant, and are not adaptable to a variety of both indoor and outdoor spaces. In this paper, we designed and constructed a bike rack to take advantage of vertical space in order to reduce the footprint that storing a bike takes. Our experiments showed that by reorienting the bike in an upright position and allowing it to travel along a main column, we were able to significantly reduce the footprint of the bike and bike rack system. Additionally, by using a simple hand wheel and pulley system, we would be able to reduce the amount of force the user would need to exert to hoist the bike upwards with a few modifications. By recognizing that the vertical space above traditional bike racks is often wasted and made unusable, we were able to design a system that maximizes its efficiency to decrease the amount of floor space required to store bikes. Our new and innovative design is a viable solution for crowded cities like San Francisco where square footage is both expensive and limited. With our data showing a possible reduction in footprint of up to 92%, implementing a vertical bike rack design has the potential to drastically change the way people get around the city and secure their individual modes of transportation.",

Despite this, there are no natural surface water systems that exist in this location today. In 1851, a Santa Clara county surveyor report showed one creek in particular that flowed nearly to the Santa Clara Mission. This area has undergone a great deal of infrastructural improvements, but the essential hydrogeological features as well as the main water systems are intact. The purpose of this report is to find the location of this fated water system, to find what circumstances would need to exist for it to resurface, and to develop design criteria for the restoration of this water system based on current conditions. The stream was located and a theory was developed to explain its disappearance. A plan was developed for the restoration of this stream that would bring a running water system back to Santa Clara University and the surrounding city. The stream was found and was redesigned such that it could be constructed in its natural location as it currently exists.

        "abstract": "The objective of the project is to design and manufacture an off-road vehicle that is able to climb hills, maneuver around technical courses, and accelerate while meeting all rules and design criteria set by SAE. To best cover all aspects of vehicle manufacture, the design process was broken down into three subsystems: transmission, chassis and suspension. The transmission is the propulsion system of the vehicle and turns the engine output into motion. The chassis serves as the primary roll cage, support system, and framework for all other subsystems. The suspension elevates the chassis from the ground as the vehicle maneuvers over rough terrain, and keeps the wheels in contact with uneven terrains. The main focus for the design of each subsystem is maneuverability. This goal is achieved through the design of a lightweight chassis, a suspension system that supports control and speed during cornering and creates a small turning radius, and a driveline that incorporates reverse functionality. For the final design, the resulting chassis is 78.1” long and 36.2” wide with a final weight of 75.9 lbs. In terms of the suspension, the resulting camber angle of the front suspension is -4.27°, with a toe angle of -0.1°, and 9.31” ground clearance. The final driveline resulted in a forward gear ratio of 13.25:1 from the gearbox, with a range of 3:1 to 0.45:1 from the CVT used in the system. This thesis outlines the planning, design, analysis and integration of the 2018 SCU Mini Baja team.",

We noticed that the current class system at SCU, Camino, in addition to keeping track of grades also features a discussion board that is heavily underused. We have come to the conclusion that students prefer using applications that specialize in a certain function, so the separation between grade trackers and collaboration systems would be more appealing. Using this system will work best for classes that focus on more difficult material, or for classes that place an emphasis on teamwork and collaboration.",

It is difficult to coordinate relief efforts in the aftermath of a disaster due to the unavailability of reliable communication methods. The SCUCube is a 3U CubeSat designed to aid disaster relief communications. The satellite has an amateur radio primary payload that can send and receive standardized data packets with compatible radios, and also has an experimental attitude control system secondary payload. The semi-passive attitude control system uses a gravity gradient boom and a reaction wheel to stabilize the orientation of the satellite. In addition, the satellite uses 3D printed and aluminum components for internal mounting features. The satellite also implements legacy work from previous Santa Clara University senior projects, including an outer structural design, a solar panel design, a distributed computing system, and an electronic power board design. SCUCube’s communication payload has demonstrated the capability to send and receive standard AX.25 data packets, as well as store messages for later downlink. Individual subsystems on the satellite have been designed, assembled and tested, and are currently integrated with one another in a ‘Flat satellite’ testing configuration. In addition, structural testing has been completed to determine if the system will survive launch. Before it may be launched, the satellite needs to be assembled in flight configuration and tested to ensure that subsystems behave as anticipated. SCUCube will provide vital communications services once it is launched, and will also test an experimental attitude control system.",

Furthermore, it utilizes the latest technologies, and the project is fully open source to increase its overall lifetime. The end goal is to provide a platform that would improve the academic environment at Santa Clara University, satisfying the needs of students and professors alike.\n After launching the platform, feedback was collected to iterate on the design and functionality to better suit the needs of our users. Once the changes were implemented, the platform was successfully relaunched with strong positive feedback. The volume of evaluations is still relatively small, but the platform is actively growing and continuously becoming more useful as data is collected. We believe further improvements to the platform are not necessary to achieve success, but it could help our users in various ways. Some of the suggested features include the ability for faculty to interact with students and an integration with the SCU registrar, if possible.",

Therefore, SCU has expressed the need to provide affordable housing for their faculty and staff who do not earn enough income to be able to live in the City of San Jose or County of Santa Clara. The project proposed in this report represents the efforts of SCU Civil Engineering students to adhere towards the social, sustainable, and economic concerns held by the CENG (CESE) Department in the design and construction of a proposed housing development for Santa Clara University faculty and staff. The team of civil engineering students, RADS Construction, LLC., has provided design recommendations for the 1200 Campbell Avenue development.\n The team gained initial inspiration from the Planned Development Zoning Submittal that was received from the City of San Jose, which contained architectural drawings provided by Studio TSquare. The team also received a map of the water facilities at the proposed project site from San Jose Water. Using the architectural drawings and a map of the water facilities on site, RADS Construction designed the structural and stormwater management plans for the development; designed potable water and wastewater piping layouts; and created a construction schedule, waste management plan, and a Building Information Modeling (BIM) model. The team decided to change the originally proposed incubator space, as displayed in the architectural drawings, into a commercial space to allow shops and other small businesses to use this new building. This change helped to address the concerns of the stakeholders in the proximity of the project site since they wanted to benefit from this new building to help compensate for bringing in more traffic into the neighborhood. Through these deliverables, RADS Construction met both social and economic needs of SCU’s faculty and staff, as well as fulfilling the CESE Departmental and School of Engineering standards for socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable engineering.",

Because of this, students turn to cheaper, faster, and more efficient alternatives for acquiring school books including online retailers such as Amazon or Barnes and Noble.\n While the Internet makes book shopping appear easier, there exist issues that come with it. Students have to put in more effort ordering online, pay for extra shipping, and wait for their books to arrive. Also, online shopping for books is incredibly decentralized with no convenient platform to cater to students' needs. Students must first spend time finding out which books are required for each class and then spend even more time comparing prices from multiple online retailers. In addition, once a student completes a class he or she may no longer need the book. As a result, the student has no convenient method of disposing the book and must now sell it, throw it away, or keep it. Overall, the process of acquiring books in university is disorganized, stressful, and inconvenient for students.",

This leads to structures that are vulnerable to seismic damage, such as the ones damaged in the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. This project addresses the need to develop a type of construction that is more affordable. The proposed mortar-less interlocking block system is intended to allow communities to create structurally sound buildings at lower costs due to reduced need for skilled masons.\n By being able to interlock the Concrete Masonry Unit (CMU) blocks, no mortar is required to connect the blocks. Integrity of the wall is ensured by adding vertical reinforcing steel that will be fed through the inside of the blocks and then block voids are filled with grout to strengthen and connect the system components. Additionally, horizontal steel rebar will be added in order to provide seismic shear resistance.\n Through testing of the interlocking block, it was determined that construction is possible using the interlocking CMU blocks and held during our testing through the Three Degrees of Freedom Seismic machine. This project showed a proof of concept for a system of interlocking CMUs, and is a stepping stone for further development and characterization of the system.",

This is much higher than it should be because it is well established that the human papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary cause of cervical cancer, and vaccinations for HPV have been available in rural Uganda since 2006. However, most rural Ugandan women are not vaccinated due to poor vaccination delivery, negative attitudes towards vaccination, and other social cultural factors. The existing sexual education system run by the Ugandan national government is ineffective, and the taboo nature of this topic makes talking about sexual health in local communities difficult.\n Rose Academies, a humanitarian organization based in Uganda, contacted us through SCU’s Frugal Innovation Hub to develop a mobile application to address these issues. Our proposed solution is SengaSafe, which would solve these issues in three ways. The first is that by making information about sexual health more easily accessible, through both the widespread usage of our app in rural Ugandan communities and the visual nature of the app, removing illiteracy as an obstacle to learning. The second was by making sexual health topics less taboo through an unobtrusive educational module system and by having our app be used only as a tool by volunteer teachers, so they can break into the discussion more easily. The third was by integrating a static map module that shows nearby vaccine clinics. An evaluation of the effectiveness of our application will have to wait until it is deployed within Uganda, although we expect good results. Ideas for future improvement include a dynamic integration with Google Maps and the inclusion of more textual information, so the app can be more useful without a teacher.",

Our results showed that we were able to map out a 2D map of the room with updates for robot motion on a display while also showing a live thermal image in front of the system.

This device is a noninvasive instrument that utilizes a balloon catheter-based system that only requires a small needle access instead of open heart surgery. The left atrial appendage has been known to cause be a location of thrombus formation in patients with atrial fibrillation, the most common form of heart arrhythmia. Fifteen percent of those who have had strokes have also had atrial fibrillation Needle access is made in the patient and the catheter is fed through the vein with a guide wire. A balloon filled with fluorescent contrast is fed along the guide wire, positioned at the appendage, and then inflated to signify the location of the catheter. On the outside of the left atrial appendage, a separate guide wire with the LARIAT Suture Delivery Device, which is comparative to a lasso, is fed through another needle access site until it meets the existing guidewire within the appendage. Both guidewires are then connected using the FindrWIRZ Magnetic Guide Wire System. The connection is accomplished magnetically with magnets that are located at the end of both guidewires. The balloon is then inflated once more and then the surgeon wraps the suture around the left atrial appendage and inflated balloon, which then successfully ligates the left atrial appendage. The balloon is then deflated and the device can be removed from the body. With this procedure, patients are typically discharged the next day. Our senior design project focuses on the problem of delivering the contrast to the balloon during surgery preparation. The balloon is repeatedly inflated and then deflated with contrast until all of the air has been evacuated from the system. If all bubbles are not removed during preparation, the bubbles inside of the device create a potential risk of stroke if the balloon bursts and the air bubbles escape the device and then travel into the bloodstream. The contrast preparation for the current device, the EndoCATH Large Occlusion Balloon, is long and tedious when compared to existing balloon catheters. The preparation of the device is currently the largest complaint among nurses. Currently, the balloon catheter is prepared by repeatedly inflating and then deflating the balloon with contrast until all of the air bubbles are eliminated from the dual-lumen device. One lumen was used for the guidewire, and the second lumen was used for contrast. For our senior design project we proposed a dual mode tri-lumen device. Through a y-arm modification we have enabled the device to work in both a preparation mode and an inflation/deflation mode. The preparation mode provides continuous flow of the contrast to the balloon to prohibit the formation of bubbles, which significantly decreased the time required for preparation. The inflation/deflation mode allows for both lumens to be used simultaneously for inflation and deflation. This essentially reverts the device back to how it functioned as the dual-lumen device. With both modes, the dual mode tri-lumen device has significantly decreased preparation time while maintaining existing inflation/deflation times.",

Many music aggregation sites exist, but only link songs by artist, title, or genre. We created a search engine to create playlists of similar music to the query for users. Our system recommends music based on a series of algorithms which compare songs actual musical qualities. Our results show a great deal of promise, all songs returned are quite similar. However speed is quite an issue. Our extraction takes almost five minutes, which is an eternity for a web application. Our comparisons can be returned at a decent rate, with about ten songs being compared every three seconds. From this, we have found that identifying a song is quicker than performing analysis, and thus we implemented an audio fingerprinting module to compensate for the speed. From our systems results, we concluded that computing similarities across these music features provides a good way to explore music, but that in order to compete with other systems such as Pandora or Spotify, we would need to have a much deeper music database as well as a player system implemented. To make our system useful, we would want to take popular songs and then find lesser known songs to give smaller artists more exposure. Serendipity is less of a playlist creator, and more of a search engine for finding new music. To realize these goals, we would need to partner with someone who can get us the music files of these lesser known artists and also address our speed issues through either a distributed system or increased optimization of our core algorithms.",

Most practice includes repetitive writing of the characters until the student memorizes the look and stroke order of a character, but this method could be improved with the addition of visuals and audio to enhance the learning experience. The stakeholders of this problem are students seeking to learn the Chinese language, and tutors looking for alternate teaching tools.\n Our project is a virtual reality (VR) experience where players enter a traditional Chinese housing complex, a siheyuan, as a child who cannot yet understand language. By using place and memory, the user can gain a greater sense of connection and understanding of Chinese written language. As the child explores the house, she witnesses the story of the previous family of the house. Rather than learn Chinese as a second language, in which each word is learned through direct translation from English, this VR experience allows the player the experience of learning Chinese as a first language.

We proposed a skin phantom educational kit that emulates the perspiration and electrical properties (i.e. impedance spectrum) of skin. This kit can mimic the effects of different sweat concentrations and geometrical structures and allows students to visualize how these properties change electrical measurements. We designed a three-layered model composed of silicone rubber sandwiched between agar, which is similar to the skin's elastomeric and porous texture. We used simple and safe equipment such as a digital multimeter and a low-voltage power source for testing our educational model.\n We also constructed a computational model using COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate important skin phantom properties. Our COMSOL model is more complex than the agar-silicone layered model in the sense that it allows analysis of the impedance spectrum as a function of the perspiration mechanics. Through our COMSOL model, we achieved simulation of perspiration and studies on the effects of electrode distance, and material conductivity and relative permittivity in relation to impedance. From these tests, the simulation proves viable for scaling up to a realistic size, as our final model is sized-down for improved model development and testing purposes.

Artificial tissue phantoms that are capable of mimicking the characteristics of human tissues are required for demonstrating a medical device’s safety and efficacy in benchtop tests. While there are many hydrogels that are able to mimic these relevant properties of human tissue, creating a protective layer which has chemical, electrical, and mechanical properties similar to skin has remained challenging. The goal of this project was to create an artificial skin layer that can be used in biowearable testing. Our team aimed to create this skin phantom using cost effective and accessible materials that can be paired with a tissue phantom to create a complete artificial phantom for biowearable testing.\n We tested materials to obtain an artificial layer with electrical and physical properties that aligned with human skin. After much testing, and inspired by the fruit skin, we were able to find that wax paper is able to serve as a skin phantom when used in conjunction with agarose gel. By placing a sheet of wax paper over an agarose gel, a complete skin phantom was generated. We tested this complete phantom to characterize its electrical behavior and created an electrical system that is able to be used as a cost-effective, rapid, and repeatable testing method.

To combat the issue of insufficient access to vaccines in developing areas, the SkyPort project has developed the SkyPort UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). The SkyPort UAV has the vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities of a quadcopter, as well as the efficient, sustained flight of a fixed-wing aircraft. It provides a cheaper, quicker, and safer delivery method than existing alternatives for vaccines in areas that lack a reliable transportation infrastructure. The role of the SkyPort Airframe Design Team was to design and build the primary support structure of the UAV, which will house the payload, controls, and propulsion systems being designed by the other two SkyPort teams. The airframe consists of a lightweight and durable fuselage, wing, tail, and framing subsystems and it is designed to be modular so that parts are easy to replace and require minimal maintenance. Primary materials used in construction were foam, carbon fiber, and aluminum. Testing of the frame yielded a weight of 8.63 kg, minimum foam strength of 1.70 MPa, and a minimum factor of safety of 16 for the structural members of the frame. Although the weight of the airframe is higher than the desired weight, this was necessary in order to satisfy the strength requirements and protect sensitive electrical components during initial flight tests. In the future, this extra weight could be decreased by using less carbon fiber, lower density foam, smaller, lighter material for the structural members, or smaller fasteners.",

One of the many facets of this problem is access to vaccine treatment. The transportation and storage of vaccines at the proper temperature is an issue that is still being solved and improved upon today. One of the common solutions to this problem is the use of passive coolers such as ice packs and other refrigerants. The potential issue with passive cooling is that the temperature cannot be actively controlled. This is evident, as many vaccines are wasted due to incorrect storage temperature. Additionally, these products are generally bulky in size. In order to solve both the issue of transportation and storage, we designed an active cooling system using thermoelectric modules that keep vaccines and blood samples at the proper storage temperature range of 2-8°C. This device was designed to be transported by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and is equipped with a temperature control system as well as a battery pack. This delivery system was conceptualized and fabricated by the SkyPort social enterprise project, a group of mechanical engineers split into teams to focus on different aspects of the system. As the team responsible for the payload, we developed a device that stores up to 6 vaccine vials and 3 blood sample vacutainers at a temperature of 5°C. The payload operates with a feedforward loop, controlled by the temperature of the chamber and environment. Our design operates in ambient temperatures of 40°C for over 10 hours. The SkyPort UAV is a viable and innovative alternative to vaccine delivery because it does not rely on ground transportation infrastructure. In addition, the temperature control system maintains the vaccines and blood samples at the required temperature range, ensuring that they remain safe during transport. This is still a proof-of-concept design and can be improved upon further to produce a refined product. The device can be improved in terms of efficiency and manufacturability in addition to user interface.",

As of now, Augmented Reality is available to the select few with the means of obtaining Google Glass, Oculus Rifts, and other relatively expensive platforms. Be that as it may, the tech industry's current goal has been integration of this technology into the public's smartphones and everyday devices. One inhibitor of this goal is the difficulty of finding an Augmented Reality application whose usage could satisfy an everyday need or attraction. Augmented reality presents our world in a unique perspective that can be found nowhere else in the natural world. However, visual impact is weak without substance or meaning. The best technology is invisible, and what makes a good product is its ability to fill a void in a person's life. The most important researchers in this field are those who have been augmenting the tasks that most would consider mundane, such as overlaying nutritional information directly onto a meal [4].\n In the same vein, we hope to incorporate Augmented Reality into everyday life by unlocking the full potential of a technology often believed to have already have reached its peak. The humble photograph, a classic invention and unwavering enhancement to the human experience, captures moments in space and time and compresses them into a single permanent state. These two-dimensional assortments of pixels give us a physical representation of the memories we form in specific periods of our lives. We believe this representation can be further enhanced in what we like to call a Smart Photo. The idea behind a Smart Photo is to unlock the full potential in the way that people can interact with photographs. This same notion is explored in the field of Virtual Reality with inventions such as 3D movies, which provide a special appeal that ordinary 2D films cannot. The 3D technology places the viewer inside the film's environment. We intend to marry this seemingly mutually exclusive dichotomy by processing 2D photos alongside their 3D counterparts.",

        "abstract": "The intent of our Senior Design Thesis was to develop a software infrastructure for Blockchain applications that is compatible with SmartNIC (smart network interface card) hardware to contribute to the future of edge computing and Blockchain. The demand on network infrastructure is exploding, with there estimated to be 41.2 billion active network connections in 2025, 30.8 of those being IOT [13]. Of these active network IOT connections, a growing plurality will contain SmartNICs, which add valuable compute into the crucial intersection between the network and individual server. With it forecasted that three-fourths of all enterprise data will be processed at the edge, SmartNICs will be a giant player in that space [9]. On the other hand, the Blockchain industry is growing at an unprecedented rate, but is running to large problems in its application, specifically its reliance on GPUs and high compute cost- Bitcoin for example consumed 110 terawatt hours in 2021, .55% of the global energy production and roughly equivalent to the size of Malaysia or Sweden [2]. We saw overlap in edge processing requiring security, the SmartNICs offering compute power on the edge, and Blockchain’s need for an alternative compatible hardware that catered to its decentralized qualities.\n In our solution, we contributed to both areas, as we made a software infrastructure that is fully run on a fourth generation SmartNIC. This infrastructure allows clients to maintain nodes, mine for currency, and send transactions to other nodes, and more- essentially the key tenets of the blockchain that are the underpinning of Blockchain applications such as smart contracts and cryptocurrency. Using C standard library, openssl, and nanomsg, we created an object oriented Blockchain infrastructure nicknamed “Lampcoin,” which we found to be stable on the SmartNIC as well as operable. The results are extremely encouraging because they point to an unique opportunity to offload a certain part of the larger blockchain work in the future to the SmartNIC, such as Bitcoin hashing work for mining or smart contract verification for Ethereum.",

        "abstract": "The majority of the energy within the United States is wasted. In addition, buildings such as apartment complexes and high-rises consume large amounts of energy, with commercial buildings wasting, on average, 30% of the energy that they consume. This issue leads to drastic consequences such as an increase in carbon footprint and high energy costs. With this in mind, our team was inspired to create a solution that decreases energy consumption and cost. Our project achieves this goal with a scalable and personalized smart home system that caters to individual users’ needs while conserving energy on a large scale. Our solution, SmartSys, cuts energy consumption as well as energy costs through interaction with IoT devices, an architecture that includes a combination of database-centric and event-driven data flows, and various technologies including sensors and machine learning. As a result of single room testing, we estimate that SmartSys will help indivdual users save over $1000 over a time period of 20 years in addition to saving a city with 20 apartment complexes over 150 million KWh after 20 years. For future work, we hope to decrease the fixed cost of SmartSys to make our solution have an even greater impact on energy cost savings while maintaining its energy saving performance. In addition, we hope to engage in multiple room testing as well as scale SmartSys to function throughout a large building.",

Due to their large size, weight and hard exterior, these robots can occasionally cause damage to the pipe interiors during inspection. In addition, these pipe inspection robots struggle with the ability to move in a congested environment and adapt to obstacles or geometry changes within the pipe. This project investigates the capabilities of auxetic and conventional metamaterials to achieve locomotion in an enclosed channel through the different metamaterials reactions to an axial force. The resulting robot is capable of both horizontal and vertical locomotion. Computer simulation is used to confirm the metamaterial􀂶s effective Poisson􀂶s ratio through testing deformation under applied loads at small displacements. Physical testing of the soft-bodied robot is employed to demonstrate the force needed for movement and validate the auxetic and conventional metamaterial behavior. The extensive work serves as a proof of concept of auxetic metamaterials as a viable solution for less invasive movement through enclosed channels. Further work and alterations to the soft-bodied robot body may allow for future applications in realms such as medical device development.",

The solar powered absorption chiller is a refrigeration system designed to provide refrigeration to these developing areas. This year, our team has worked to develop a system where the sun's rays are collected as heat to power an absorption refrigerator. The goal of this project was to take an existing solar tracker system and use its collected heat to power a refrigerator. Our team designed and built heat exchangers to extract heat from the concentrated solar system; assembled components for a fluid circulation loop; and retrofitted an absorption chiller refrigerator to be powered by our heated fluid. Additionally, we redesigned an existing solar tracking system to improve function and decrease power consumption. By the end of this year we assembled the entire system and performed months of solar testing as well as proof-ofconcept testing that the refrigerator could receive necessary heat through a heated fluid. By the end of the school year, we concluded that the heated fluid would need to reach 150°C to begin the refrigeration cycle (with current heat exchanger design), which was 25° higher than our solar testing had achieved. With further improvements, the refrigerator could be designed to run with lower heat inputs and the tracker system could be designed to attain heat at higher temperatures. With these changes, a working refrigeration system could have dramatic impacts on farming communities in developing countries; reducing food spoilage, increasing family income, and preventing food-borne illnesses.",

        "abstract": "Current potable water demands in developing nations exceed existing water delivery infrastructure, increasing the prevalence of waterborne diseases. This thesis describes a standalone off-grid water purification system designed to produce clean drinking water in an economically viable manner. The system utilizes concentrated solar-thermal energy generated by reflective parabolic troughs to boil sea, brackish, or contaminated water for distillation. The resulting water vapor is condensed into clean water and stored in a collection tank. System optimization and design (heat exchanger, boiler, parabolic troughs, tracking and control system, photovoltaic panels and vapor and heat transfer fluid pumps) and specifically parabolic trough fabrication are discussed in detail. Two troughs were designed and constructed each with an area of 3.07 m2 (33 ft2). Duratherm 450, a non-toxic, non-hazardous heat transfer fluid (HTF) is selected as the working fluid for the solar trough hot loop. System performance analysis was conducted through a combination of experimental testing and through a virtual system model utilizing Engineering Equation Solver (EES). EES is used to model the heat transfer process of the overall distillation system, optimal HTF flow rates, and future system scalability. Experimental results show a maximum system operating temperature of 124oC and maximum performance for the numerically determined optimal HTF flow rate. Furthermore, results show that parabolic troughs are suitable for distillation and are less expensive to manufacture, operate at a higher temperature, and provide higher performance when compared to a distillation system that utilizes flat thermal panels. The overall manufacturing cost is approximately $5000, which includes tracking, a control system, and all other components related to distillation. This system is designed to fit into a standard 20-foot shipping container for ease of transportation worldwide.",

While the technology has been available for the past few years, there are not many compelling AR applications available on mobile phones. Additionally, shared AR experiences are difficult to produce and share. In order to create a compelling AR application, we created StickARs, an iOS application that makes it easy to create and share AR experiences , by placing virtual stickers anywhere in the world.\n StickARs allows users to choose from a predefined set of sticker templates, add text to stickers, and place them share them with the public, or with specific friends. Users can opt to add tags to their stickers, and subscribe to tags to see stickers that interest them.\n The greatest obstacle we faced was our ability to create a world-scale shared experience. We split the entire world into equal sized chunks called worldmaps that users instantiate the first time they place a sticker at that location. This allows users to only download the worldmaps they actually visit. However due to geolocation and AR limitations, the transition between worldmaps is not quite as smooth as we had originally hoped. We hope that in the future, Apple will extend the functionality of their AR Application Programming Interface to allow larger-scale experiences, which will allow us to create a smoother shared AR experience.",

        "abstract": "The current problem with energy backup and grid stabilization systems is that both either require fuel and constant maintenance, such as diesel generators, or cannot perform at their peak operation and need constant replacement, like batteries. Our solution and the goal of the StorWatts senior design project was to design and create a small-scale compressed air energy storage system to be used in place of traditional energy backup and grid stabilization systems. The StorWatts system does not need fuel in order to store and generate power and therefore does not require constant refueling and maintenance. It also can work in most any climate, not needing environmental control like its battery counterparts. This allows for a standalone system that can perform reliably for years at a time. This StorWatts CAES system will convert electrical energy into mechanical energy by compressing air into a set of air storage tanks. When power is needed, the air will be released from the storage tanks through an expander. The expander, connected to a DC generator, will convert the stored energy into usable electric power. The StorWatts team, with a generous donation from the Biederer family, repurposed an old Briggs and Stratton four stroke gas engine into an air expander. The existing cylinder head was removed and redesigned to allow room for a thermocouple, a pressure transducer, a 500 psi safety release valve and two fast acting solenoids, one for inlet air and one for outlet exhaust air. The solenoids were controlled by an arduino with set open and close times. However, due to safety concerns and time restrictions, we unable to test the system above 70 psi. This created problems as the arduino was set for an inlet pressure of 500 psi. The engine was unable to turn over at 70 psi and no running information was obtained.",

The scope of this project included the design of a model tiny home structure, the design of water resource systems to meet in-home community water demands, the municipal design of the development, and a construction cost estimation of a single tiny home. It did not deeply explore further details such as the electricity or agriculture, which may be expanded upon in future iterations of this project.",

        "abstract": "Sunny-Side Solutions is a solar water heating and shower system designed for Naretu Academy in Narok, Kenya, to provide the academy's teachers a simple, reliable, and frugal method of receiving hot water for daily showers. After thorough research and testing, the final system's main components are ½ diameter, 54.9 m long irrigation piping solar collector, a 100 L insulated hot water tank, and a 67 W circulation pump. These components ensure that all water that enters the system will be able to achieve a final temperature of 38 °C and maintain this temperature until the teachers shower and drain the hot water tank. With the solar collector optimally angled towards the sun, a final theoretical temperature of 43.1 °C was reached, equating to a temperature difference of 17.8 °C. Sunny-Side Solutions' solar system is not only more time efficient for the teachers, as does not require constant watch like boiling water does, but it also saves Sabore's Well 57.6 % compared to Kenya's leading market solar solution. A hot water shower serves as a form of appreciation for all the hard work the teachers put in to supporting the Maasai community and its children's education. In order to further optimize and test the Sunny-Side Solutions solar system at Naretu Academy, an instruction manual, visually outlining how to build the solar collector, and informational pamphlet, containing materials, substitutes, and suggestions to simplify the building process, was sent to Sabore's Well.",

Due to the lack of affordable, easily installable solar panel systems on residential properties, the goal of our Senior Design Project is to design a stand-alone solar tracking structure. Since the system is stand-alone, it can be easily implemented on a wide range of properties in most areas of California. Our design for the support of the solar tracking system is a two-pole structure, with a wide base under each pole to eliminate the need for a deep foundation. An electric gearmotor system will drive the rotational motion of the solar tracking function, due to its high power output and relatively affordable cost. A hydraulic damping and blocking system was incorporated to precisely control rotational motion. After testing the system for both tracking and static operation, an 11.4% increase power production was observed. Sunplanter solar tracking systems have the potential to provide a financially viable investment opportunity for customers while having a positive impact on the environment.",

Conventional energy storage components, such as lithium-ion batteries, use electrochemical reactions to store and release electrons into a system. These batteries are slow to charge, highly toxic to the environment and delicate compared too many of the systems they are used in. Supercapacitors are noticeably more rugged and last hundreds to thousands of times longer than the average chemical reaction-based batteries we are used to using while capable of charging in less than half the time. Creating a power module that properly handles the use of supercapacitors is the main focus of this project. The power circuitry included in this design compensates for the design complications inherent to using supercapacitors, allowing future designers to more easily integrate supercapacitors as an energy storage solution into their designs. The power module is capable of charging three supercapacitors in series to 8.1 volts in one hour.",

Traditional homes in Gambibgo are constantly rebuilt, costing the communityaround $250 at least once every five years. Our team, with Father James Reites, S.J. and two alums, traveled to Gambibgo in March 2015 with an earthen roof design we had hoped to implement on the existing walls of thecommunity's homes. Upon our arrival we realized that our assumptions regarding the stability of a set of existing walls were incorrect, which led to our implementation of a Nubian vault, whileworking with the Nubian Vault Association (AVN), a non-governmental organization founded 15 years ago in France. With the help of AVN and two experienced Nubian vault masons, the Gambibgo community constructed the first Nubian vault built in rural Ghana by the local population. The success of this building method relies on the ability of AVN to attract investors; however, the AVNhas little to no technical data regarding the structural analysis of the building method. Our research provided us with useful information regarding Nubian vaults, and this research will becontinued in the following academic year as two rising seniors, Philip Mirenda and JosephPapangellin.

Current treatment options for sleep apnea include CPAP, oral appliances, and surgery. Of these options, hyoid suspension surgery is one of the most effective, but is significantly underutilized. This is due to the fact that performing hyoid suspension surgery by current methods is complicated and can be painful for the patient. As our senior design project, we designed and prototyped a novel medical device that facilitates fast, easy, and consistent hyoid suspension surgery. Through functional testing of our device in foam, ballistic gel, cow tendon, and human cadaver, we were able to prove the efficacy of our device for use in hyoid suspension surgery. We were also able to demonstrate through benchtop testing that our device is able to consistently output the force required to puncture the tissue surrounding the hyoid bone. Our device was successful in meeting all of our project goals and successfully proved our method as a viable proof of concept. To further develop this product and move toward commercialization, the displacement of the needle at the tip of the device should be increased, the method for carrying the suture should be revised, and the profile of the device should be decreased as much as possible.",

Drones are very helpful for first responders such as firefighters, police, and even ranchers and large landowners. Most drones have a fixed wing. This report will show the design, construction, and fluid dynamic testing of a drone that has multiple wing positions. These modes are the straight wing position and swept back position. This design will change the flight profile of the plane, allowing for the user to launch at a faster speed and the glider to get to the desired location faster. Once the glider is at the desired location the wings can sweep forward to the straight position for more control. More control allows for better surveillance of an area. The wind tunnel was used to test drag and lift on models of our glider. Tests were done on three models: one straight wing model, one model with wings swept back 17.5°, and one model with wings swept back 25°. These models were also tested at multiple angles of attack between -15° to 15° in 5° increments. It was determined that, as the wings swept back, the models produced more drag. The straight wing model produced 0.393 lbs. of drag, the 17.5° model produced 1.09 lbs. of drag, and the 25° model produced 0.7 lbs. of drag. There were insufficient tests for lift that produced correct data. After these wind tunnel tests, a mechanism was implemented on the commercially available glider, the Radian Pro, that sweeps the wing back 25°. Once this was implemented, a flight test was conducted to compare models.",

These drugs come with a variety of side e↵ects, ranging from common to very rare. However, the symptoms listed on drug packaging might not be the only symptoms that a consumer might experience when taking a specific drug. When experiencing a symptom, consumers might think they have a disease, turn to the Web for answers, and attempt to diagnose themselves when a disease is not necessarily the cause. Instead, these symptoms might be reactions to medications; however, the first thought that people have when experiencing a symptom is that they most likely have a disease. This often hinders us from thinking of alternative solutions. In addition, people often take multiple drugs simultaneously, which makes pinpointing the source of a bad reaction or unexpected symptom increasingly difficult. These factors make it challenging to locate the true source of a symptom. Our product, Symptom Search, is a tool that assists in this search for answers. Symptom Search uses FDA Adverse Effects Report data and machine learning to provide users with a method to search for potential root causes of their symptoms.

Data structures become extremely important when managing large amounts of data, whether it be as simple as managing statistics for a basketball team, or as critical as accounts for online banking. The current way to learn data structures is through classes and online Java applets. In classes, most professors teach by drawing the data structure and editing the information on a board. Data structure tutorial websites mimic this visual way of teaching. No one, single site includes all types of data structures, which can be confusing and inconvenient for programmers. Current websites that teach data structures use Java applets which are obsolete, insecure, and run slowly. Most popular browsers disable Java by default because of these concerns. In order to use Java applets, users first find a site that has the proper data structure. Then, users must enable Java on the page in order to run the applet. When Java is disabled, browsers open a pop-up window informing users of Javas security risks and asking them if they would like to enable Java. Most users are discouraged by pop-ups because they are either unfamiliar with the warning or are concerned with security risks and will navigate away from the page. Finally, because each website is different, a user must adapt to the interface of that particular applet. We will have built a website that provides users with one, single place to find all the data structures they need. Our website includes most of the common data structures and allows users to easily create their own if they are not included. We have developed a pseudocode language, and accompanying compiler, that allows users without advanced web programming backgrounds to create their own data structures. Users describe their data structures in a high level, pseudocode language which is then be translated into code appropriate for the web. Users are able to create data structures in our language and the compiler handles the programming necessary to display that data structure visually. Our site makes use of modern web technologies, such as JavaScript and HTML5, to avoid the downfalls associated with Java applets.

If the cause of a genetic disease can be determined, correction of this gene would allow for an efficient and permanent cure. However, current technologies utilizing engineered retroviruses have serious drawbacks that significantly limit their practical applications for gene therapy. In this project we investigate a novel genetic editing technology called TALENs. By utilizing a modular protein isolated from a plant pathogen that can be quickly and efficiently redesigned to recognize and bind to any desired sequence of DNA combined with a nuclease, we can target a double stranded break at any location in the genome, setting off a cascade of events we can exploit to insert a new sequence of DNA at the site of the double stranded break. While the goal is to develop the TALENs technology for use on humans, extensive research is needed before human trials can be conducted. Our group is testing this in the model organism C. elegans, a soil nematode used for genetic studies. One advantage of doing this is the ability to microinject fluid into the gonad of a young adult worm, which will be absorbed by forming oocytes (eggs) during development. Thus any genetic change will be permanent in the subsequent generations. This fluid will contain two important components: mRNA that will code of the TALENs protein to create the double stranded break at the desired location, and a DNA segment that contains homology, or matching base pairs on both sides of the double stranded break, allowing the cell to repair itself with the provided template. We will be tagging our particular gene of interest, lin-39, with GFP to visualize its expression while simultaneously demonstrating the ability to utilize TALENs technology to insert a full gene into the genome. We have successfully created the mRNA and template components to inject into C. elegans. Continued work on this project will produce a useful GFP fusion protein for the Miller lab and will also demonstrate a viable genetic engineering technology that will eventually facilitate gene therapy.",

Rural and low income communities in particular have been severely impacted by the lack of accessibility to in-person healthcare. This has created the need for access to remote patient monitoring and virtual health visits in order for greater accessibility to premier care. In this paper, we propose hardware security primitives as a viable solution to meet the security challenges of the telehealth market. We have created a novel solution, called the High-Low (HiLo) method, that generates physical unclonable function (PUF) signatures based on process variation within flash memory in order to uniquely identify and authenticate remote sensors. The HiLo method consumes 20x less power than conventional authentication schemes, has an average latency of only 39ms for signature generation, and can be readily implemented through firmware on ONFI 2.2 compliant off-the-shelf NAND flash memory chips. The HiLo method generates 512 bit signatures with an average error rate of 5.9 * 10-4, while also adapting for flash chip aging. Due to its low latency, low error rate, and high power efficiency, we believe that the HiLo method could help progress the field of remote patient monitoring by accurately and efficiently authenticating remote health sensors.",

This report contains an indepth look at the design approach we are taking to create our product. Our design utilizes a thermoelectric cooler combined with heat sinks and heat pipes to efficiently cool air to its dew point temperature and then reheat the air prior to sending it into a clothes dryer intake. Cooling the air to dew point temperature allows moisture to be removed from the air consequently decreasing the relative humidity. Throughout our design process we obtained simulation results providing a theoretical temperature the air needs to be cooled down to in order to remove moisture based on various design conditions. Our results showed that for conditions of 27 °C (80 °F) and 80% relative humidity, based on a design state of Hawaii, we require at least a 4 °C temperature difference across the cold side heat sink. Results from experimental testing in Santa Clara, CA on our two iterations of prototypes yielded a maximum temperature difference of approximately 2 °C. After applying our future plans to further idealize our prototype design as well as incorporating design conditions based on our simulation results, we aim to further increase our temperature difference allowing us to prove our theoretical results experimentally.",

In this project, we designed technology that reads naturally occuring biosignals from the body, which then can be apply those signals with any interface. For our specific application in this project, we decided to implement a keyboard. Instead of teaching the fingers how to type on a mechanical keyboard, the body can designate an action with a more native motion. We aim to take ‘body language’ to the next level. By making the human body the centerpiece, and building the interconnects between people (reading and comprehending EMG signals), we strive to create a more interconnected world. Using our custom implementation of an analog to digital converter, the amplitude of EMG signals at carefully placed muscle probes are collected and translated into a digital signal. The resulting signal values are sent to a remote server where key characteristics are calculated. The backend of the system consists of a mathematical model that continuously uses these calculated characteristics to re-parameterize itself for recognition. After the signals are recognized, they are assigned an appropriate output at the user’s request.

        "advisor": "Ahmed Amer",
        "abstract": "The New Grid seeks to provide mobile users with an additional method for off-grid communication, or communication without connection to Internet infrastructure. The motivation for this project was to find another alternative to Internet-dependent communication. Current Internet infrastructure is antiquated; it is expensive to maintain and expand, it has numerous vulnerabilities and high-impact points of failure, and can be rendered unusable for lengthy periods of time by natural disasters or other catastrophes. This current grid will eventually need to be replaced by a more modern, scalable, and adaptive infrastructure. The results of the projects research showed that implementing a library to allow for the creation of mobile peer-to-peer mesh networks could serve as a starting point for a transition from current Internet infrastructure to a more scalable, adaptive, and reliable Internet- independent network grid.\n Development of The New Grid largely followed the Rational Unified Process, in which the development process is split into four phases: requirements gathering, system design, implementation, and testing. Most of quarter was spent outlining functional requirements for the system, designing possible methods of implementation, and researching similar solutions that seek to transition mass mobile communication to a newer, more modern network grid. The New Grid differs from similar solutions because it has been implemented as a modular library. Current systems that allow for off-grid mobile connection exist as independent applications with a defined context and predetermined usability scope.\n We, the design team, found that implementing the system in the form of a modular library has multiple benefits. Primarily, this implementation would allow The New Grid to be deployed as widely as possible. Developers can both write applications around our library as well as include specific modules into existing applications without impacting other modules or introducing additional overhead into a system. Another benefit of deploying the system as a modular library is adaptability. The current, initial stable build of The New Grid uses Bluetooth Low Energy as its backbone for facilitating communication within large networks of mobile devices; however, this library could use any existing or future communication protocol to facilitate connection as long as a hook is written to allow The New Grid to interface with that protocol. Thus, The New Grid is not limited by which connection protocols currently exist, a property that other similar systems do not possess.\n The New Grid can be used in any application that requires connection between users. The most common applications would likely be messaging, file sharing, or social networking. While developers may find a variety of uses for The New Grid, its primary purpose is to facilitate reliable connection and secure data transfer in an environment with a large user base. Achieving this goal was proven feasible through research and testing the library with a small cluster of Android devices communicating solely with Bluetooth Low Energy. Expanding this group of a few phones to a larger mesh network of hundreds of devices was shown to be feasible through testing the librarys algorithms and protocols on a large network of virtual devices. As long as developers seek to create applications that allow users to communicate independent of Internet infrastructure, The New Grid will allow smartphone users to communicate off-grid and hopefully spur a switch from infrastructure-dependent mobile communication to user-centric, adaptive, and flexible connection.",

Automated ventilation and watering systems create a microclimate within this greenhouse structure to create the ideal growing conditions for seeds. The main purposes of the cold frame are to lengthen the growing season, be maintenance free, and enhance garden education. From testing, the project goals were verified to have been achieved through several performance metrics. First, the system’s ability to lengthen the growing season is dependent on germinating seedlings that can be planted earlier in the season. The automated system maintained the seedlings at the proper soil moisture levels to grow. The system also implemented passive temperature control systems to maintain the plants in ideal conditions. With the ventilation and thermal mass, the system is able to be cooler at the hottest times of day and warmer at night than unprotected plants. The system has also successfully automated the care of the seedlings, achieving our goal of being maintenance free. Finally, the enhancement of garden education was incorporated through community engagement with the design and building of the cold frame, as well as the Bluetooth application which will be used in the school curriculum.",

In this project, we examine the interaction of two putative cancer biomarkers, Bax and PDCDS, using the tetracycline repressor-based mammalian two-hybrid system (trM2H). This in vivo system engineers the cell as a biosensor using methods of DNA cloning and mammalian cell transfections that easily detects and quantities the interaction of two proteins by the production of GF P. The results of our experiments indicate that Bax and PDCDS do not directly interact but have a high affinity for forming individual homodimers. Although more experiments should be done to validate these claims, the genetic evidence we provide can dispute the proposed cell signaling pathway involving Bax and PDCDS with confidence. Success of our experiments also supports the trM2H system as a valid, versatile, and simple method of studying protein-protein interactions in vivo and with biological relevance.",

        "abstract": "A fuel efficient cookstove tailored to the needs of Nicaraguan small business owners that incorporated insulation and thermoelectric power generation was built and validated. There is a 4 inch layer of pumice rock insulation around the combustion chamber, which significantly reduces convective heat losses to the environment. The stove's ventilation system is powered by the electricity generated by thermoelectric generators. Preheated air is forced into the combustion chamber, which increases the combustion efficiency, reducing the fuel consumption and the harmful smoke produced. Through various testing methods, we found that the controlled airflow to the charcoal fuel allows the stove to maintain the desired cooking temperature 38% longer that the standard inefficient stoves. This longer burn time translates directly into fuel savings, as the operator requires less fuel to accomplish the same cooking task. It is estimated that a customer could save at least $200/year on fuel, which represents two month's salary in Nicaragua. Compared to uninsulated stoves, our design reduces the outer wall temperature by 700° F, which is a significant safety improvement.

OSA is a prevalent condition affecting every 1 in 5 adults in the United States over the age of 30.1 Current treatment options include surgical treatments such as tongue suspension, where sutures are inserted into the base of the tongue and then adjusted and tethered to the mandible with the aid of bone screws. This allows the tongue to be suspended to open the airway. Although this method has proven to be an effective and permanent fix for OSA, there are some potential areas of improvement that can be made to the current method regarding the elasticity, migration, adjustability, and removal of the suture. To address these areas, our design project focuses on the design and manufacture of an elastic, self-adjusting silicone tongue suspension suture. Our final design selection of a “Notch Method” aids in eliminating migration of the suture and eliminates the need to attach the suture to the mandible. We created our low cost silicone suture in bulk using a mechanical roller, a heated press, and a vinyl cutter. Biocompatibility testing shows that the suture does not cause complications. Tensile testing showed that the suture had desired elasticity and ductility, while displacement testing confirmed that the suture would be comfortable during everyday movements. Inserting the suture through a pig tongue also confirmed what suture dimensions could feasibly be implanted and then tightened into position within the tongue. With these results, along with future mechanical testing and the presentation of our new proposal design to an E.N.T. surgeon for feedback, our new OSA treatment will be one step closer to being a product on the medical market.",

Using a control system and GUI made in LabVIEW, a magnetic particle as our torque actuator, and a Futek rotary torque sensor for precise data acquisition, our device is a creative, efficient, and effective replacement to Hansen’s quality testing. We successfully develop an equivalent test, surpassed our goal of decreasing test time, our fixture is completely modular for all Hansen’s RCMs, we integrated two tests into a single operation, and we received favorable feedback from the engineers and technicians whom proposed this project. This project succeeded in creating a functional prototype to replace Hansen Medical’s current test protocol. Our test system has been handed off to Hansen Medical for implementation and further development.",

As more restaurants and attractions open up in popular cities, the wait and travel time from one location to another inevitably increases. Each attraction has certain hours throughout the day where visitors surge and the wait times increase. In addition, traffic and travel time is an important factor to consider when looking to optimize ones trip. However, with large amounts of attractions, it is difficult to calculate and consider the most optimal routes and times an individual should use to visit each possible attraction. Travelers ultimately face an issue with maximizing productivity for their trips. Our goal is to create a mobile application that utilizes the data from the Google Directions API and Foursquare API to produce an optimal itinerary for travelers to use. Travelers will be able to input their place of stay, attractions they want to visit at their preferred times, and other time constraints to produce an itinerary that will allow the tourist to visit each attraction they please. The Optimal Itinerary Generator will eliminate blind spots in travel planning and as a result, make vacation trips more time efficient and enjoyable.",

        "abstract": "Originally, the Internet was meant as a general purpose communication protocol, transferring primarily text documents between interested parties. Over time, documents expanded to include pictures, videos and even web pages. Increasingly, the Internet is being used to transfer a new kind of data which it was never designed for. In most ways, this new data type fits in naturally to the Internet, taking advantage of the near limit-less expanse of the protocol. Hardware protocols, unlike previous data types, provide a unique set security problem. Much like financial data, hardware protocols extended across the Internet must be protected with authentication. Currently, systems which do authenticate do so through a central server, utilizing a similar authentication model to the HTTPS protocol. This hierarchical model is often at odds with the needs of hardware protocols, particularly in ad-hoc networks where peer-to-peer communication is prioritized over a hierarchical model. Our project attempts to implement a peer-to-peer cryptographic authentication protocol to be used to protect hardware protocols extending over the Internet.\n The TrusNet project uses public-key cryptography to authenticate nodes on a distributed network, with each node locally managing a record of the public keys of nodes which it has encountered. These keys are used to secure data transmission between nodes and to authenticate the identities of nodes. TrusNet is designed to be used on multiple different types of network interfaces, but currently only has explicit hooks for Internet Protocol connections.\n As of June 2016, TrusNet has successfully achieved a basic authentication and communication protocol on Windows 7, OSX, Linux 14 and the Intel Edison. TrusNet uses RC-4 as its stream cipher and RSA as its public-key algorithm, although both of these are easily configurable. Along with the library, TrusNet also enables the building of a unit testing suite, a simple UI application designed to visualize the basics of the system and a build with hooks into the I/O pins of the Intel Edison allowing for a basic demonstration of the system.",

        "abstract": "With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, an overabundance of information related to the virus was released through social media. While more information can ultimately help people learn about the virus and how to protect themselves from it, there has been a lack of uniformity amongst individual states and the federal government in regards to policies and health guidelines (69), which may lead to the public being confused on the best guidelines to follow. There has also been an ideological divide driven by political polarization in the US on how to respond to this pandemic, causing greater contention (17; 86; 37; 46). Analyzing the public’s response to COVID-19 state-level policies on social media can help us to better understand the progression of the pandemic in the US.\n We analyze public sentiment from Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit data related to policies such as shelter-in-place orders, school reopening guidelines, and face mask guidelines using machine learning sentiment analysis methods and compare the results by performing significance testing. We use the COVID-19 cases and deaths and state demographics to analyze and contextualize the results during the timelines that these social media posts were published. We found that users had more positive sentiments in response to mask policies than to shelter-in-place and school reopening policies and that there are statistically significant differences in public sentiment when comparing the same policies between several states. Finally, we found that when testing the significance of sentiment differences for different policies within the same state, the majority of the statistically significant differences were found within states that were considered to be swing states in 2020. We suggest that further research be done to analyze why these differences exist and what factors may impact public sentiment regarding COVID-19 public health policies.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disease that affects 6.2 million people worldwide. The most popular clinical method to measure PD tremor severity is a standardized test called the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), which is performed subjectively by a medical professional. Due to infrequent checkups and human error introduced into the process, treatment is not optimally adjusted for PD patients. According to a recent review there are two devices recommended to objectively quantify PD symptom severity. Both devices record a patient’s tremors using inertial measurement units (IMUs). One is not currently available for over the counter purchases, as they are currently undergoing clinical trials. It has also been used in studies to evaluate to UPDRS scoring in home environments using an Android application to drive the tests. The other is an accessible product used by researchers to design home monitoring systems for PD tremors at home. Unfortunately, this product includes only the sensor and requires technical expertise and resources to set up the system. In this paper, we propose a low-cost and energy-efficient hybrid system that monitors a patient’s daily actions to quantify hand and finger tremors based on relevant UPDRS tests using IMUs and surface Electromyography (sEMG). This device can operate in a home or hospital environment and reduces the cost of evaluating UPDRS scores from both patient and the clinician’s perspectives. The system consists of a wearable device that collects data and wirelessly communicates with a local server that performs data analysis. The system does not require any choreographed actions so that there is no need for the user to follow any unwieldy peripheral. In order to avoid frequent battery replacement, we employ a very low-power wireless technology and optimize the software for energy efficiency. Each collected signal is filtered for motion classification, where the system determines what analysis methods best fit with each period of signals. The corresponding UPDRS algorithms are then used to analyze the signals and give a score to the patient. We explore six different machine learning algorithms to classify a patient’s actions into appropriate UPDRS tests. To verify the platform’s usability, we conducted several tests. We measured the accuracy of our main sensors by comparing them with a medically approved industry device. The our device and the industry device show similarities in measurements with errors acceptable for the large difference in cost. We tested the lifetime of the device to be 15.16 hours minimum assuming the device is constantly on. Our filters work reliably, demonstrating a high level of similarity to the expected data. Finally, the device is run through and end-to-end sequence, where we demonstrate that the platform can collect data and produce a score estimate for the medical professionals.",

In rural and underdeveloped areas, patients are often disadvantaged when it comes to finding reliable and affordable healthcare. The isolation provided by their location and the rising costs of physicians makes it impossible for most impoverished communities to attain personalized care. Because of this, treatable diseases often go unaddressed, allowing diseases to progress to a critical condition. Mortality rates have shown to be higher in communities located in rural areas and among destitute economies. Telemedicine is one solution to improve rural health care by allowing patients to have remote access to health services. Our goal for this project would be to provide simple and fast diagnosis to detect urine albumin levels, urobilinogen, nitrite, as well as pH and glucose levels combined with telemedicine to provide reliable results.\n Thus far, we have completed tests for the previously mentioned parameters and have reached out to the World Health Partners in order to propose collaboration on the project.

        "abstract": "Phobias, defined as a persistent and often irrational fear of an object or situation, are a very common type of anxiety disorder that can make it extremely difficult if not impossible for sufferers to interact with the world in a normal and healthy fashion. Traditionally therapists have used a concept known as systematic desensitization to help patients gain control of the emotional and physical reaction to their phobia. Systematic desensitization is employed using a type of treatment known as exposure therapy in which the patients are gradually made to think about and eventually face whatever triggers their anxiety until they are able to control their response during full exposure. While this treatment method can prove effective for some patients, we have identified two major problems with it. First, many patients are reluctant to undergo treatment and would rather ignore their phobia than be forced to face it. Second, depending on the type of phobia, treatment can quickly become expensive if the therapist has to travel with the patient outside of the office. This paper outlines a system we developed that implements emerging virtual reality technologies as a tool for therapists to supplement the traditional treatments for anxiety disorders such as phobias. Our system uses the Oculus Rift, the Leap Motion, a mobile application, and a simulation running in the Unity Game Engine to create an immersive virtual experience for the patient while still giving the therapist the necessary control over the treatment. We believe that this system has the potential to provide therapists with a safer, more controlled, cheaper, and ultimately more effective way to expose their patients to their phobias.",

A critical component of the VBS is the variable buoyancy devices (VBDs), composed of two 60 mL syringes and a linear actuator. Three VBDs take on water from the surrounding environment to change the weight and balance of the vehicle, thereby influencing its depth, pitch and roll. Given the use of depth and orientation sensors, a closed loop control system was developed to execute independent depth, pitch and roll commands. Functionality was verified and performance was characterized through tests in a pool, showing stable control with minimal steady state error. Additional testing was performed with a thruster, which proved the prototype’s ability to maintain depth during motion.

The Variable Drive Vehicle (VDV) employs a actuated systemcapable of switching between wheeled and tracked drive modes. This allows the vehicle to travel quickly and efficiently over smooth terrain and to traverse more arduous terrain by switching between these two systems. The small scale prototype built over the course of this project is equipped with two modular wheel driven track units to demonstrate the viability of the system. Electric linear actuators and servo motors allow for simple control and a smooth transition between each drive system. These devices allow the modular tracks to be rotated out from under the wheels, and stowed on the vehicle when not in use. Finite element analysis ensured that the VDV’s switchingmechanism maintains safe loading at its most critical points during a drive system transition. The VDV was tested on smooth concrete to determine its maximum wheel speed, track speed, and how fast the drive system could be switched. Experiments yielded a top speed of 11.5 mph in the wheel mode, 0.8mph in the track mode, and a switching time of 6.4 seconds. The vehicle’smaximumobstacle clearance, 1 inch in track mode and 2 inches in wheel mode, and slope, 5 degrees in track mode and 22 degrees in wheel mode, fell short of expected values. These shortcomings resulted from a poor frictional power transfer when attempting to power the tracks using the wheels. However, this prototype provides a proof of concept for a variable drive system successfully incorporating two drive systems, and future improvements may yield a promising platformfor future robotics research.",

        "abstract": "Millions of injured people are transported by ambulances each year. While the suspension systems of ambulances dampen the road vibrations felt by the passengers, they do not attenuate the vibration completely. To patients who have compromised physical states, vibration and displacement can aggravate their condition and cause additional pain. Our solution to this societal problem is the Vibration Attenuating Medical Platform (VAMP). VAMP consists of an aluminum and steel structure that is moved with a pneumatic piston. This prototype is designed to fit into existing ambulances and attenuate the vibrations not eliminated by the ambulances suspension. After conducting background research, we found that max displacement in a vehicle is 4 inches. Using a factor of safety of 1.5 we selected a 12-inch stroke length piston, with the neutral piston position at 6 inches extended. A PID control system will be used for the half scale prototype to verify system movement, while a MIMO system is planned as the final full-scale system. No testing was performed on the physical prototype, but extensive analyses were conducted on all components of the system to ensure that they would interface well once assembled.",

The goal of the project is to further automate the winemaking process by creating a hand-held device to analyze the health of grapes throughout their life cycle. Through working with viticulturists, two key measurements were identified: sugar content, measured in Brix, and acidity, measured in pH. The team has created a device where the user inputs a bunch of grapes, crushes the cluster, inputs the type of grape and the row-column location within the vineyard, and presses a button. The rest of the process is then automated until the grape skins and stems are to be removed. There are products available to help with the testing process but our device simplifies a number of tedious processes into one simple process, allowing the farmer to accurately record data digitally, uploading it to a database on a server which can be accessed through a web interface. Digital storage also allows the farmer to have access to historical data, which allows for them to optimize their processes over the years. The device allows them to do all of this with an accuracy of ±0:1 pH and ±0:6 Brix.",

A business owner obtains this coverage, as well as other needed insurance policies, by communicating with a commercial insurance broker.\n While insurance has existed for a couple of centuries, the process to obtain policies has remained mostly the same and has not completely adapted technologically to attract the new wave of millennial business owners. The business insurance industry will need to address how this technologically savvy generation will want to buy and negotiate their insurance policies. Currently, buying business insurance has many faults. The common means of communication, fax, postal service and in-person communication are very outdated and out of touch with our millennial business owners. These slower communication methods make understanding commercial insurance more confusing for millennial business owners.\n Our solution to bring business insurance into the digital age is by creating a web application that will act as a virtual broker platform. Business owners can take a variety of actions regarding their insurance policies, all in one place. They will easily be able to request a quote, fill out policy applications, communicate with their broker and view information about their policies. Through this web application, sensitive information is protected by the construction of a secure database and implementation of industry standard information security measures.",

Due to the limited amount of time, a few risks arise; they may not have collected enough evidence, the evidence itself may not have captured the full scope of the scene, and the possibility that the evidence itself may have been damaged or destroyed. Our aim is to develop a low-cost, customizable VR crime scene reconstructor. This software allows CSI as well as the court to revisit a crime scene by inputting only the necessary components of the crime in question based on previously collected data and witness accounts. Rather than using expensive cameras to capture an overly-realistic scene, a solution that is not computationally expensive is required because of not only the amount time it takes to render the setting, but also the requirement of high-end hardware to process the data. We propose a reconstructor that allows the user to construct the scene piece by piece, which lets the user understand the details individually rather than as a whole picture.We believe our VR simulator will be helpful not only in training CSI investigators but also in the courtroom by allowing juries to concentrate on the most pertinent details of a scene.",

        "abstract": "Innovation in health care in the developing world has seen vast improvements over the last few decades. As technology has continued to rapidly improve, the use of mobile devices and cellular networks has dramatically increased in developing countries, revolutionizing economical and health applications. Telemedicine is defined by the World Health Organization as the use of electric signals via information and communication technology to provide health care and allow for the exchange of medical records in environments that lack access to adequate health care. Distance has become increasingly irrelevant as advancements in telemedicine allow for patients to video conference with a healthcare professional, or take pictures of an ailment and send them to the professional for diagnosis.\n Our team aims to improve telemedicine techniques by allowing the doctor(s) involved to have access to a patient's vital signs quickly and simply enough that a healthcare professional does not need to be present. The technology would allow for a better and more efficient diagnosis of the patient. We created a kit equipped with sensors that will be used to take a patient’s vital signs, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen concentration. This frugal vital sign kit will, in the future, have the capacity to send the information to an integrated mobile application that would synchronize the patient’s vitals with their medical records and deliver the information to their doctor. The information currently is read using a computer connected to the system by a USB cable.\n We began by creating our device based on research of current, similar devices on the market. As we developed our system, human subject testing needed to be conducted in order to improve its accuracy. Our results proved that human testing aided in the accuracy of our system, yet we did not achieve the amount of accuracy we had hoped. In order to do so, a larger sample size would be needed for human testing. We concluded that a frugal vital sign system with integration to telemedicine is indeed possible, and should provide a meaningful way for people in underdeveloped areas to get the healthcare they need.",

People living in rural India often times cannot afford to pay to see a doctor should they need to make the journey to a hospital. Telemedicine, a breakthrough in the past couple decades, has broken down the barrier between the patient and the physician. It has slowly been implemented in India to make doctors more available to patients through the use of video conferences and other forms of communication.\n A compact and affordable kit has been developed that will be used to take a patient’s blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose concentration and oxygen saturation. Our most novel contribution is the non-invasive glucose sensor that will use a near-infrared LED and photodiode in the patient’s earlobe. Currently millions of diabetics do this by pricking their finger.

The aircraft can be easily deployed in less than a couple minutes reducing search time, costs only $2000 saving SAR teams money, and allows for camera integration for hiker location. The aircraft used a pre-built airframe with added modifications, and a specifically designed avionic system to have vertical and horizontal flight capabilities. The propulsion system was tested individually in the vertical and horizontal flight modes. The quadcopter system ran in an altitude hold mode for approximately 8 minutes while the forward flight system ran for over triple that, approximately 25 minutes. This proved our VTOL aircraft’s main objective of increased fixed-wing flight efficiency. The modified airframe structure was proved not to fail under vibrational and static loading using FEA. The total weight of the aircraft is 1.9 kg, meaning we need approximately 18.6 N to fly.

The second phase is placing the wafer onto the wafer plate and removing it from the wafer plate when the growth is done. Our project will focus on the first phase which we have divided into three tasks. Task 1 is to create an automated system for sealing and unsealing the furnace door. Task 2 is to create an automated system for sliding the furnace door along the furnace track. Task 3 is to test systems to assure furnace functionality is maintained after implementation. To date we have completed the automated sealing assembly, the motor-pulley system, and integrated them into Aligned Carbon’s furnace such that they function as one complete system. Furthermore, our testing shows that our implementation does produce the desired results to reduce human intervention. For full system automation, the second phase of the project needs to be realized.

        "abstract": "In Uganda, the majority of the population lives in rural villages that rely on last-mile distribution for goods such as vaccines, fresh water, trade goods, and other forms of humanitarian relief. Last-mile distribution refers to the last mile (or few miles) that goods must be transported in order to reach their final destination from a main delivery hub. Coordination is one of the primary issues that exist when trying to solve the last-mile problem. In this paper we present our solution to this problem: an SMSbased, on-demand ride-sharing service designed to empower the people of rural Uganda by helping organize the transport of both people and goods. Our application functions similarly to the popular ride-sharing app Uber or Lyft but does not require a smartphone to use. Users text a predefined number to request a ride, get paired with a nearby boda-boda driver (these motorcycle drivers currently offer ride-sharing services to rural Ugandans by word-of-mouth), and are transported to their destination. The service also allows users to specify trailer requirements in case they need to transport goods as well. By building Wakabi around the existing boda-boda system we are not only helping to coordinate last-mile distribution efforts, but are also improving the efficiency of the existing boda-boda drivers that provide transportation to rural Ugandans. Following the 20142015 academic year, Fulbright Scholar and business partner Ty Van Herweg will be responsible for both testing and deploying Wakabi in Uganda. We hope that our application will help boda-boda drivers better serve their riders, and provide businesses with an ideal and cost-effective last-mile distribution solution.",

To counteract these alarming and increasing rates of THMs, measures need to be taken to ensure the future of safe drinking water for the St. Helena community. This team created four (4) different potential solutions to help the St. Helena Water Treatment Plant combat the effects of climate change, specifically forest fires. In this report lies four potential additions to the St. Helena Water Treatment Plant to ensure its future functionality as the effects of climate change increase. Without addressing this problem, forest fires can make water treatment plants ineffective and limit affected areas’ access to safe drinking water. This report aims to reveal water treatment solutions that would be a viable addition to a water treatment plant in Northern California that is encountering problems due to a contaminated watershed. These solutions are: Ion Exchange, Air Stripping, Granular Activated Carbon, and Powdered Activated Carbon.",

In this paper, we will explain the design process and build of the fountain, using Neopixels (RGB LEDs) to generate the light used as the main art element. An Arduino is used as the control unit, controlling the Neopixels and receiving input data from the user interface, composed by arcade buttons and a LCD screen with a mounted touchscreen, where users can interact with the fountain by choosing between four different modes of operation, including light shows where LEDs light up in preprogramed sequences, some games as Simon-says or choosing the color of each LED with the help of the touchscreen and light shows combined with music through the performance of a spectrum analyzer controlled by a raspberry pi where the LEDs dance with the music. In the end, the fountain is going to be placed in the engineering building as the design is not minted to endurance the outdoors conditions.",

Accessories like smart phones are fundamental for daily life and business functions because they are quickly becoming our computers, cameras, wallets, and even keys. Whether it is a smart phone or not, we believe that people need an option to securely keep their valuables on them at all times, even in the water. Our project goal was to create a waterproof pocket that could be retrofitted into swimwear. Multiple prototypes of the pocket have been fabricated and tested to optimize the design. With testing and optimization, our team successfully produced a waterproof capsule that passes our initial prototype requirements. This prototype passed an abusive 80 minute washer machine cycle test while remaining waterproof and maintaining its robust form. Though we have not fully integrated our opening/closure mechanism with the capsule itself, our initial testing has provided the necessary results needed in order to further the progression of our products to meet a successful design for manufacturability. Our next steps require a detailed analysis of the manufacturing process for common swim trunks in order to devise an easy system to integrate our pocket into current swim apparel. The pocket is ready to move to a mass manufacturable product that we may implement into the marketplace.",

The project aims to address this need through the design wearable health platform that uses novel, non-invasive techniques to monitor biometrics with the eventual goal to provide user insights into current health status and identify early stages of illness associated with COVID-19. This wearable utilizes PPG and temperature sensing technology in order to provide accurate measurements of the three aforementioned vitals: temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). Our system has shown promise early in development, having only marginal differences in heart rate measurements with comparable commercial sensors (0.17%-3.92%).

If these injuries are left untreated, permanent disability can result. Therefore, rehabilitation is necessary to improve and restore the function of the hand.

Additionally, clinically significant milestones in these treatment programs, such as a 10° improvement in joint range of motion, often do not necessarily translate to improved quality of life for patients who can no longer perform every day activities due to their impairments. Thus, we propose a low cost, easy to use strain-sensing device that uses a fun and interactive interface to help patients visualize and monitor the progress they make in their physical therapy programs. This device is designed and fabricated using microfluidic principles to detect small changes in strain caused by changes in joint range of motion without the use of complex electronic components, making it a sensitive, easy to use method of monitoring patient progress in rehabilitation programs. We were able to successfully create a device that detects small changes in strain caused by a bending joint.

Current systems were found to be too expensive, needed constant maintenance, or access to isolated storage of 1,000+ gallons of water. Through research of misting systems, the effectiveness of mist as a radiation shield, and working with members of CalFire, it was determined that the system needed to meet the following parameters to be effective and meaningfully implemented: (1) cost under $5,000 to develop, (2) The ability to maintain a minimum of 40% relative humidity, (3) ease of use and setup, (4) independent from main electrical and water sources. This report explores the development and tests of a wildfire prevention and suppression (WIPS) system solution for Santa Cruz homeowners. Tests were conducted to determine defensible coverage, humidity increase rate, ideal mister size, and a complete WIPS system was developed and tested at a CalFire site. The proof of concept system was capable of delaying and mitigating damage to property and met the parameters listed above.

        "abstract": "Recently, brain trauma caused by multiple concussions has become a pressing issue for contact sports, mainly American football players. The severity of the impacts in these sports have led to discussion concerning the standard safety equipment used, as well as the rules enforcing a certain style of play. Multiple studies have shown that concussions have damaging long-term effects, including dementia and memory loss. The dominant professional football organization, the National Football League (NFL), employs qualified athletic trainers to diagnose and treat players with concussions, but many incidents still go undetected. This problem is magnified at the youth level, where the appropriate personnel and equipment are not readily available, further complicating the detection and treatment of concussions. Our senior design team worked to create a system that helps athletes and trainers detect severe head impacts that may result in concussions. Our system consists of a small transmitting device comprised of an accelerometer and microcontroller, and a mobile application that will work on the Apple iPad and iPhone, but can later be tailored to any Bluetooth-enabled smartphone or tablet. We were able to design a working system that includes one device connected to a mobile application, while proposing network architecture that would support multiple devices connecting to a single mobile application. In the near future we hope that our product will help create a safer sporting environment by decreasing the odds that a concussion will go undetected and untreated. We expect that data collected from our devices will help researchers prevent concussions and head trauma. Our goal is to encourage participation in contact sports like football without the fear of long-term consequences. We hope that our device can also be modified for use in other areas where brain damage is a major issue, such as the military.",

In this paper, we discuss our wireless impact sensing headband technology that aids in the awareness and detection of potential concussions, from inception through design completion. Through the use of a custom-built validation system capable of simulating impact collisions, along with a series of experiments and revisions, our team was able to build a device that can sense and transmit data throughout the majority of the impact range of standard concussions. This system has the potential to help millions of athletes around the world be much better prepared in the event of a potentially life-threatening head impact. However, while our system is able to accurately detect and transmit impact data in real time, we found that additions such as the ability to sample at a much higher rate than experimented with, a more ergonomic design, and a lightweight, durable enclosure would be needed in order for our product to be a viable mass-market competitor. Although the product is not ready for the mass market as of today, it will be a vital part to larger systems used for predictive analytics and more innovative and robust athletic game strategy.",

The project plan for the design of this platform includes first completing necessary research into current RF-to-DC conversion strategies to help guide our design decisions for the component blocks of the platform, then to model the component blocks using simulation software. The initial plan also included the fabrication and testing of a physical prototype, but the COVID-19 pandemic changed our plan and forced us to move to full virtual simulation and testing. Our final receiver can be broken into four basic component blocks: the band-pass filter, matching network, rectifier, and voltage regulator. The band-pass filter filters out unwanted frequencies, the matching network minimizes power loss to reflection, the rectifier converts AC to DC, and the voltage regulator ensures the voltage output does not damage the device being charged[6][7]. To best simulate real world conditions, a Monte Carlo simulation with physical tolerances as well as a noise analysis was conducted.

By utilizing a nearby water well, the retreat center looks to recharge the lake and sustain its water levels, essentially restoring its natural ecosystem. The issue is that the well water is contaminated with high amounts of nitrates, which is not only an issue for the lake’s health, but also is very unsafe for human consumption. In order to design a water treatment system that is ecofriendly, sustainable, and cost-efficient, the team looked to construct and test the effectiveness of a denitrifying woodchip bioreactor. This design will serve as a prototype for a much larger implementable system that will be able to handle the flow rates from the water being pumped from the contaminated well. To run the tests, a 300 gallon steel tank served as the bioreactor apparatus that facilitated the process of denitrification using heterotrophic bacteria which consumes the nitrates in the water and synthesizes them into nitrogen gas. The prototype demonstrated that denitrifying bacteria, using the woodchips as a growth source, effectively reduce nitrate levels to meet government-mandated standards, and can be implemented on a larger scale.",
