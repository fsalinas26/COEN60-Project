                        <p class = "note">- We utilized several principles from the UCD model</p>
                        <p class = "note">- Our design is based specifically on meeting users' needs</p>
                        <p class = "note">- We focused on allowing users to complete any relevant use cases</p>
                        <p class = "note">- Students should be able to easily access any relevant resources, as this is the main functional requirement of the website</p>

                        <p class = "note">- We focused on keeping our navigation structure simple</p>
                        <p class = "note">- A complicated navigation structure would likely distract from the important content of the website</p>
                        <p class = "note">- There are three main pages: Projects, Advisors, and About</p>
                        <p class = "note">- All pages can be accessed easily via the navbar</p>

                        <p class = "note">- We focused on keeping our website structure open, with a good amount of margins and blank space</p>
                        <p class = "note">- Our sections where projects and advisors are displayed take up the majority of the page</p>
                        <p class = "note">- Students should be able to very clearly see what their search results have returned, and should be able to filter through these results themselves</p>
                        <p class = "note">- Any "junk" content that isn't related to specific use cases from students was placed in the margins of the page</p>

                        <p class = "note">- We chose to use the same colors as the SCU website; we got the hex values directly from scu.edu's stylesheet</p>
                        <p class = "note">- SCU students will likely be comfortable with this color palette</p>

                        <p class = "note">- We included a small banner at the top of the page</p>
                        <p class = "note">- This was done mainly for aesthetics, and to match the SCU-type design</p>
                        <p class = "note">- All of our titles/banners are very minimal; we don't want huge banners taking up a lot of valuable space</p>
                        <p class = "note">- We instead focused on creating banners with contrasting colors to allow them to stand out, but still be out of the way</p>

                    <div class = "design">

                        <p class = "note">- Although our website is designed for students, accessibility is still extremely important to consider</p>
                        <p class = "note">- We utilized large font for important content</p>
                        <p class = "note">- Additionally, our color palette provides high-contrast colors which should benefit visually impaired users.</p>
                        <p class = "note">- Our simple design naturally makes it easier for people with cognitive disabilities to navigate the website and utilize all of its functions</p>
